<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This delicate story is Louis Couperus&rsquo; third
novel. It appeared in the original Dutch some twenty-seven years ago
and has not hitherto been published in America. At the time when it was
written, the author was a leading member of what was then known as the
&ldquo;sensitivist&rdquo; school of Dutch novelists; and the reader
will not be slow in discovering that the story possesses an elusive
charm of its own, a charm marking a different tendency from that of the
later books.</p>

<p class="first">Dolf Van Attema, in the course of an after-dinner
stroll, had called on his wife&rsquo;s sister, Cecile van Even, on the
Scheveningen Road. He was waiting in her little boudoir, pacing up and
down, among the rosewood chairs and the <i lang="fr">vieux rose
moir&eacute;</i> ottomans, over and over again, with three or four long
steps, measuring the width of the tiny room. On an onyx pedestal, at
the head of a sofa, burned an onyx lamp, glowing sweetly within its
lace shade, a great six-petalled flower of light.</p>
<p>Mevrouw was still with the children, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>putting them to bed, the maid
had told him; so he would not be able to see his godson, little Dolf,
that evening. He was sorry. He would have liked to go upstairs and romp
with Dolf where he lay in his little bed; but he remembered
Cecile&rsquo;s request and his promise on an earlier occasion, when a
romp of this sort with his uncle had kept the boy awake for hours. So
Dolf van Attema waited, smiling at his own obedience, measuring the
little boudoir with his steps, the steps of a firmly-built man, short,
broad and thick-set, no longer in his first youth, showing symptoms of
baldness under his short brown hair, with small blue-grey eyes, kindly
and pleasant of glance, and a mouth which was firm and determined, in
spite of the smile, in the midst of the ruddy growth of his crisp
Teutonic beard.</p>
<p>A log smouldered on the little hearth of nickel and gilt; and two
little flames flickered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3"
name="pb3">3</a>]</span>discreetly: a fire of peaceful intimacy in that
twilight atmosphere of lace-shielded lamplight. Intimacy and
discreetness shed over the whole little room an aroma as of violets; a
suggestion of the scent of violets nestled, too, in the soft tints of
the draperies and furniture&mdash;rosewood and <i>rose
moir&eacute;</i>&mdash;and hung about the corners of the little
rosewood writing-table, with its silver appointments and its
photographs under smooth glass frames. Above the writing-table hung a
small white Venetian mirror. The gentle air of modest refinement, the
subdued and almost prudish tenderness which floated about the little
hearth, the writing-table and the sofa, gliding between the quiet folds
of the faded hangings, had something soothing, something to quiet the
nerves, so that Dolf presently ceased his work of measurement, sat
down, looked around him and finally remained staring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>at the
portrait of Cecile&rsquo;s husband, the minister of State, dead
eighteen months back.</p>
<p>After that he had not long to wait before Cecile came in. She
advanced towards him smiling, as he rose from his seat, pressed his
hand, excused herself that the children had detained her. She always
put them to sleep herself, her two boys, Dolf and Christie, and then
they said their prayers, one beside the other in their little beds. The
scene came back to Dolf as she spoke of the children; he had often seen
it.</p>
<p>Christie was not well, she said; he was so listless; she hoped it
might not turn out to be measles.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was motherliness in her voice, but she did not
seem a mother as she reclined, girlishly slight, on the sofa, with
behind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>her the soft glow of the lace flower of light on its
stem of onyx. She was still in the black of her mourning. Here and
there the light at her back touched her flaxen hair with a frail golden
halo; the loose crape tea-gown accentuated the maidenly slimness of her
figure, with the gently curving lines of her long neck and somewhat
narrow shoulders; her arms hung with a certain weariness as her hands
lay in her lap; gently curving, too, were the lines of her girlish
youth of bust and slender waist, slender as a vase is slender, so that
she seemed a still expectant flower of maidenhood, scarcely more than
adolescent, not nearly old enough to be the mother of her children, her
two boys of six and seven.</p>
<p>Her features were lost in the shadow&mdash;the lamplight touching
her hair with gold&mdash;and Dolf could not at first see into her eyes;
but presently, as he grew accustomed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6"
href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>to the shade, these shone softly
out from the dusk of her features. She spoke in her low-toned voice, a
little faint and soft, like a subdued whisper; she spoke again of
Christie, of his god-child Dolf and then asked for news of
Am&eacute;lie, her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all well, thank you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You may
well ask how we are: we hardly ever see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go out so little,&rdquo; she said, as an excuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just where you make a mistake: you do not get half
enough air, not half enough society. Am&eacute;lie was saying so only
at dinner to-day; and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve looked in to ask you
to come round to us to-morrow evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will come. I shall be very pleased.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but why do you never come of your own accord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t summon up the energy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you spend your evenings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read, I write, or I do nothing at all. The last is really
the most delightful: I only feel myself alive when I am doing
<i>nothing</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a funny girl. You really don&rsquo;t deserve
that we should like you as much as we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; she asked, archly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it makes no difference to you. You can get on just
as well without us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that; it&rsquo;s not true. Your
affection means a great deal to me, but it takes so much to induce me
to go out. When I am once in my chair, I sit thinking, or not thinking;
and then I find it difficult to stir.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horribly lazy mode of life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there it is!&hellip; You like me so much: can&rsquo;t
you forgive me my laziness? Especially when I have promised you to come
round to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was captivated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;Of course you are
free to live as you choose. We like you just the same, in spite of your
neglect of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, reproached him with using ugly words and rose slowly to
pour him out a cup of tea. He felt a caressing softness creep over him,
as if he would have liked to stay there a long time, talking and
sipping tea in that violet-scented atmosphere of subdued refinement:
he, the man of action, the politician, member of the Second Chamber,
every hour of whose day was filled up with committees here and
committees there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying that you read and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>wrote a good
deal: what do you write?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love writing letters. I write to my brother and sister in
India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is not the only thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else do you write then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re growing a bit indiscreet, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he laughed back, as if he were quite within
his right. &ldquo;What is it? Literature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! My diary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed loudly and gaily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep a diary! What do you want with a diary? Your days
are all exactly alike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed they are not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders, quite non-plussed. She had always been a
riddle to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>him. She knew this and loved to mystify him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes my days are very nice and sometimes very
horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he said, smiling, looking at her out of his
kind little eyes.</p>
<p>But still he did not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so sometimes I have a great deal to write in my
diary,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see some of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means &hellip; after I&rsquo;m dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mock shiver ran through his broad shoulders:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brr! How gloomy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! What is there gloomy about that?&rdquo; she asked,
almost merrily.</p>
<p>But he rose to go:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You frighten me,&rdquo; he said, jestingly. &ldquo;I must be
going home; I have a lot to do still. So we see you
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, yes: to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand; and she struck a little <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>silver
gong, for him to be let out. He stood looking at her a moment longer,
with a smile in his beard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re a funny girl, and yet &hellip; and yet we
all like you!&rdquo; he repeated, as if he wished to excuse himself in
his own eyes for this affection.</p>
<p>And he stooped and kissed her on the forehead: he was so much older
than she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad that you all like me,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Till to-morrow, then. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He went; and she was alone. The words of their
conversation seemed still to be floating in the silence, like vanishing
atoms. Then the silence became complete; and Cecile sat motionless,
leaning back in the three little cushions of the sofa, black in her
crape against the light of the lamp, her eyes gazing out before her.
All <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>around her a vague dream descended as of little
clouds, in which faces shone for an instant, from which low voices
issued without logical sequence of words, an aimless confusion of
recollection. It was the dreaming of one on whose brain lay no
obsession either of happiness or of grief, the dreaming of a mind
filled with peaceful light: a wide, still, grey Nirvana, in which all
the trouble of thinking flows away and the thoughts merely wander back
over former impressions, taking them here and there, without selecting.
For Cecile&rsquo;s future appeared to her as a monotonous sweetness of
unruffled peace, in which Dolf and Christie grew up into jolly boys,
young undergraduates, men, while she herself remained nothing but the
mother, for in the unconsciousness of her spiritual life she did not
know herself entirely. She did not know that she was more wife than
mother, however fond she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>might be of her children. Swathed in
the clouds of her dreaming, she did not feel that there was something
missing, by reason of her widowhood; she did not feel loneliness, nor a
need of some one beside her, nor regret that yielding air alone flowed
about her, in which her arms might shape themselves and grope in vain
for something to embrace. The capacity for these needs was there, but
so deep hidden in her soul&rsquo;s unconsciousness that she did not
know of its existence nor suspect that one day it might assert itself
and rise up slowly, up and up, an apparition of more evident
melancholy. For such melancholy as was in her dreaming seemed to her to
belong to the past, to the memory of the dear husband whom she had
lost, and never, never, to the present, to an unrealized sense of her
loneliness.</p>
<p>Whoever had told her now that something was wanting in her life
would have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>roused her indignation; she herself imagined that
she had everything that she wanted; and she valued highly the calm
happiness of the innocent egoism in which she and her children
breathed, a happiness which she thought complete. When she dreamed, as
now, about nothing in particular&mdash;little dream-clouds fleeing
across the field of her imagination, with other cloudlets in their
wake&mdash;sometimes great tears would well into her eyes and trickle
slowly down her cheek; but to her these were only tears of an
unspeakably vague melancholy, a light load upon her heart, barely
oppressive and there for some reason which she did not know, for she
had ceased to mourn the loss of her husband.</p>
<p>In this manner she could pass whole evenings, simply sitting
dreaming, never wearying of herself, nor reflecting how the people
outside hurried and tired themselves, aimlessly, without being happy,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>whereas she was happy, happy in the cloudland of
her dreams.</p>
<p>The hours sped and her hand was too slack to reach for the book upon
the table beside her; slackness at last permeated her so thoroughly
that one o&rsquo;clock arrived and she could not yet decide to get up
and go to her bed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next evening, when Cecile entered the Van
Attemas&rsquo; drawing-room, slowly with languorous steps, in the
sinuous black of her crape, Dolf at once came to her and took her
hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be annoyed. Quaerts called; and Dina
had told the servants that we were at home. I&rsquo;m
sorry&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she was a little irritated, in her sensitiveness, at
unexpectedly meeting this stranger, whom she did not remember ever to
have seen at Dolf&rsquo;s and who now rose from where he had been
sitting with Dolf&rsquo;s great-aunt, old Mrs. Hoze, Am&eacute;lie and
the two daughters, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>Anna and Suzette. Cecile kissed the old lady
and greeted the rest of the circle in turn, welcomed with a smile by
all of them. Dolf introduced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend Taco Quaerts&#8202;&hellip;. Mrs. van Even, my
sister-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat a little scattered round the great fire on the open hearth,
the piano close to them in the corner, its draped back turned to them,
and Jules, the youngest boy, sitting behind it, playing a romance by
Rubinstein and so absorbed that he had not heard his aunt come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules!&hellip;&rdquo; Dolf called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; said Cecile.</p>
<p>The boy did not reply and went on playing. Cecile, across the piano,
saw his tangled hair and his eyes abstracted in the music. A feebleness
of melancholy slowly rose within her, like a burden, like a burden that
climbed up her breast and stifled her breathing. From time to time,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span><i>forte</i> notes falling suddenly from
Jules&rsquo; fingers gave her little shocks in her throat; and a
strange feeling of uncertainty seemed winding her about as with vague
meshes: a feeling not new to her, one in which she seemed no longer to
possess herself, to be lost and wandering in search of herself, in
which she did not know what she was thinking, nor what at this very
moment she might say. Something melted in her brain, like a momentary
weakness. Her head sank a little; and, without hearing distinctly, it
seemed to her that once before she had heard this romance played so,
exactly so, as Jules was now playing it, very, very long ago, in some
former existence ages agone, in just the same circumstances, in this
very circle of people, before this very fire&#8202;&hellip;. The
tongues of flame shot up with the same flickerings as from the logs of
ages back; and Suzette blinked with the same expression <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>which
she had worn then on that former occasion&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Why was it that Cecile should be sitting here again now, in the
midst of them all? Why was it necessary, to sit like this round a fire,
listening to music? How strange it was and what strange things there
were in this world!&hellip; Still, it was pleasant to be in this cosy
company, so agreeably quiet, without many words, the music behind the
piano dying away plaintively, until it suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hoze&rsquo;s voice had a ring of sympathy as she murmured in
Cecile&rsquo;s ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we are getting you back, dear? You are coming out of your
shell again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecile pressed her hand, with a little laugh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never hid myself from you! I have always been in to
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we had to come to you. You always stayed at home,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not angry with me, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, darling, of course not; you have had such a great
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have still: I seem to have lost everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How was it that she suddenly realized this? She never had that sense
of loss in her own home, among the clouds of her day-dreams, but
outside, among other people, she immediately felt that she had lost
everything, everything&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have your children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered faintly, wearily, with a sense of loneliness, of
terrible loneliness, like one floating aimlessly in space, borne upon
thinnest air, in which her yearning arms groped in vain.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hoze stood up. Dolf came to take her into the other room, for
whist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too, Cecile?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you know I never touch a card!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>He did not press her; there were Quaerts and the girls to make
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there, Jules?&rdquo; he asked, glancing
across the piano.</p>
<p>The boy had remained sitting there, forgotten. He now rose and
appeared, tall, grown out of his strength, with strange eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing?<span class="corr" id="xd26e496" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I &hellip; I was looking for something &hellip; a piece of
music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit moping like that, my boy!&rdquo; growled
Dolf, kindly, with his deep voice. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of those
cards again, Am&eacute;lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said his wife, looking about
vaguely. &ldquo;Where are the cards, Anna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they in the box with the counters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dolf grumbled. &ldquo;Nothing is ever where it
ought to be.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>Anna got up, looked, found the cards in the drawer of a buhl
cabinet. Am&eacute;lie also had risen, stood arranging the music on the
piano. She was for ever ordering things in her rooms and immediately
forgetting where she had put them, tidying with her fingers and
perfectly absent in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anna, come and draw a card too. You can play in the next
rubber,&rdquo; cried Dolf, from the other room.</p>
<p>The two sisters remained alone, with Jules.</p>
<p>The boy had sat down on a stool at Cecile&rsquo;s feet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, do leave my music alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Am&eacute;lie sat down beside Cecile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Christie better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a little livelier to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. Have you never met Quaerts before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? He comes here so often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecile looked through the open folding-doors at the card-table. Two
candles stood upon it. Mrs. Hoze&rsquo;s pink face was lit up clearly,
with its smooth and stately features; her hair gleamed silver-grey.
Quaerts sat opposite her: Cecile noticed the round, vanishing
silhouette of his head, the hair cut very close, thick and black above
the glittering white streak of his collar. His arms made little
movements as he threw down a card or gathered up a trick. His person
had something about it of great power, something energetic and robust,
something of every-day life, which Cecile disliked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the girls fond of cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suzette is, Anna not so very: she&rsquo;s not so
brisk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecile saw that Anna sat behind her father, looking on with eyes
which did not understand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take them out much nowadays?&rdquo; Cecile asked
next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have to. Suzette likes going out, but not Anna.
Suzette will be a pretty girl, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suzette&rsquo;s an awful flirt!&rdquo; said Jules. &ldquo;At
our last dinner-party&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t tell you. It&rsquo;s not right to tell
tales, is it, Auntie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecile smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want always to do what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he said deprecatingly. &ldquo;Everything seems
to me so bad, do you know. Why is everything so bad, Auntie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is much that is good too, Jules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Everything <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>is bad.
Everything is very bad. Everything is selfishness. Just mention
something that&rsquo;s not selfish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parents&rsquo; love for their children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jules shook his head again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parents&rsquo; love is ordinary selfishness. Children are a
part of their parents, who only love themselves when they love their
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules!&rdquo; cried Am&eacute;lie. &ldquo;Your remarks are
always much too decided. You know I don&rsquo;t like it: you are much
too young to talk like that. One would think you knew
everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I always say that we never know anything. We never know
anything, don&rsquo;t you agree, Cecile? I, at least, never know
anything, never&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked round the room absently. Her fingers smoothed the fringe
of her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>chair, tidying. Cecile put her arm softly round
Jules&rsquo; neck.</p>

<p class="first">It was Quaerts&rsquo; turn to sit out from the
card-table; and, though Dolf pressed him to go on playing, he rose:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go and talk to Mrs. van Even,&rdquo; Cecile heard
him say.</p>
<p>She saw him come towards the big drawing-room, where she was still
sitting with Am&eacute;lie&mdash;Jules still at her feet&mdash;engaged
in desultory talk, for Am&eacute;lie could never maintain a
conversation, always wandering and losing the threads. She did not know
why, but Cecile suddenly assumed a most serious expression, as though
she were discussing very important matters with her sister; and yet all
that she said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules ought really to take lessons in harmony, when he
composes so nicely&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>Quaerts had approached; he sat down beside them, with a scarcely
perceptible shyness in his manner, a gentle hesitation in the brusque
force of his movements.</p>
<p>But Jules fired up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Auntie, I want to be taught as little as possible! I
don&rsquo;t want to be learning names and principles and
classifications. I couldn&rsquo;t do it. I only compose like this, like
this&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; And he suited his phrase with a vague
movement of his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules can hardly read, it&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; said
Am&eacute;lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he plays so nicely,&rdquo; said Cecile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Auntie, I remember things, I pick them out on the piano.
Oh, it&rsquo;s not really clever: it just comes out of myself, you
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s so splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! You have to know the names and principles and
classifications. You <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28"
name="pb28">28</a>]</span>want that in everything. I shall never learn
technique; I&rsquo;m no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes for a moment; a look of sadness flitted across
his restless face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know a piano is so &hellip; so big, a great piece of
furniture, isn&rsquo;t it? But a violin, oh, how delightful! You hold
it to you like this, against your neck, almost against your heart; it
is almost part of you; and you stroke it, like this, you could almost
kiss it! You feel the soul of the violin quivering inside its body. And
then you only have just a string or two, two or three strings which
sing everything. Oh, a violin, a violin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; Am&eacute;lie began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, oh, Auntie, a harp! A harp, like this, between your
legs, a harp which you embrace with both your arms: a harp is exactly
like an angel, with long golden hair&#8202;&hellip;. Ah, I&rsquo;ve
never yet played on a harp!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29"
href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules, leave off!&rdquo; cried Am&eacute;lie, sharply.
&ldquo;You drive me silly with that nonsense! I wonder you&rsquo;re not
ashamed, before Mr. Quaerts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jules looked up in surprise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before Taco? Do you think I&rsquo;ve anything to be ashamed
of, Taco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of his voice was like a caress. Cecile looked at him,
astonished; she would have expected him to make fun of Jules. She did
not understand him, but she disliked him exceedingly, so healthy and
strong, with his energetic face and his fine, expressive mouth, so
different from Am&eacute;lie and Jules and herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jules glanced at his mother with a slight look of disdain, as if to
say that he knew better:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see! Taco&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his footstool round towards <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>Quaerts and laid his head
against his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let him be, mevrouw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one spoils that boy&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except yourself,&rdquo; said Jules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I! I!&rdquo; cried Am&eacute;lie, indignantly. &ldquo;I spoil
you out and out! I wish I knew how not to give way to you! I wish I
could send you to Kampen or Deli!<a class="noteref" id="xd26e661src"
href="#xd26e661" name="xd26e661src">1</a> That would make a man of you!
But I can&rsquo;t do it by myself; and your father spoils you
too&#8202;&hellip;. I can&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s going to become of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is going to become of you, Jules?&rdquo; asked
Quaerts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I mustn&rsquo;t go to college, I am too
weak a doll to do much work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to go to Deli some day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with you&#8202;&hellip;. Not alone; oh, to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>be
alone, always alone! You will see: I shall always be alone; and it is
so terrible to be alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jules, you are not alone now!&rdquo; said Cecile,
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, in myself I am alone, always
alone&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pressed himself against Quaerts&rsquo; knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules, don&rsquo;t talk so stupidly,&rdquo; cried
Am&eacute;lie, nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; cried Jules, with a sudden half sob.
&ldquo;I will hold my tongue! But don&rsquo;t talk about me any more;
oh, I beg you, don&rsquo;t talk about me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He locked his hands and implored them, with dread in his face. They
all stared at him, but he buried his face in Quaerts&rsquo; knees, as
though deadly frightened of something&#8202;&hellip;. <span class=

<p class="first">Anna had played execrably, to Suzette&rsquo;s despair:
she could not even remember the winning trumps!</p>
<p>Dolf called out to his wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am&eacute;lie, do come in for a rubber; that is, if Quaerts
doesn&rsquo;t want to. You can&rsquo;t give your daughter many points,
but still you&rsquo;re not quite so bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather stay and talk to Mrs. van Even,&rdquo; said
Quaerts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and play without minding me, if you prefer, Mr.
Quaerts,&rdquo; said Cecile, in the cold voice which she adopted
towards people whom she disliked.</p>
<p>Am&eacute;lie dragged herself away with an unhappy face. She did not
play a brilliant game either; and Suzette always lost her temper when
she made mistakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have so long been hoping to make your acquaintance,
mevrouw, that I should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>not like to miss this opportunity,&rdquo;
Quaerts replied.</p>
<p>She looked at him: it troubled her that she could not understand
him. She knew him to be something of a Lothario. There were stories in
which the name of a married woman was coupled with his. Did he wish to
try his blandishments on her? She had no particular hankering for this
sort of pastime; she had never cared for flirtations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, calmly, immediately regretting the
word; for her question sounded like coquetry and she intended anything
but that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he echoed.</p>
<p>He looked at her in slight surprise as he sat near her, with Jules
on the ground between them, against his knee, his eyes closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because &hellip; because,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;because
you are my friend&rsquo;s sister, I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34"
href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>suppose, and I had never met you
here&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no answer: in her seclusion she had forgotten how to talk
and she did not take the least trouble about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used often to see you at the theatre,&rdquo; said Quaerts,
&ldquo;when Mr. van Even was still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the opera,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? I didn&rsquo;t know you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been out in the evening for a long time, because
of my mourning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I always choose the evening to come to
Dolf&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that explains why we have never met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent for a moment. It seemed to him that she spoke very
coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should love to go to the opera!&rdquo; murmured Jules,
without opening his eyes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>&ldquo;Or no, after all, I think I
would rather not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dolf told me that you read a great deal,&rdquo; Quaerts
continued. &ldquo;Do you keep in touch with modern
literature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little. I don&rsquo;t read so very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I have two children; that leaves me very little time
for reading. Besides, it has no particular fascination for me: life is
much more romantic than any novel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are a philosopher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Oh, no, I assure you, Mr. Quaerts! I am the most
commonplace woman in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with her wicked little laugh and her cold voice: the voice
and the laugh which she employed when she feared lest she should be
wounded in her secret sensitiveness and when therefore she hid deep
within herself, offering to the outside <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>world something very
different from what she really was. Jules had opened his eyes and sat
looking at her; and his steady glance troubled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live in a charming house, on the Scheveningen
Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She realized suddenly that her coldness amounted to rudeness; and
she did not wish this, even though she did dislike him. She threw
herself back negligently; she asked at random, quite without concern,
merely for the sake of conversation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you many relations in The Hague?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; my father and mother live at Velp and the rest of my
family at Arnhem chiefly. I never fix myself anywhere; I can&rsquo;t
stay long in one place. I have spent a good many years in
Brussels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no occupation, I believe?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No. As a boy, my one desire was to enter the navy, but I was
rejected on account of my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily she looked into his eyes: small, deep-set eyes, the
colour of which she could not determine. She thought they looked sly
and cunning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always regretted it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I am
a man of action. I am always longing for action. I console myself as
best I can with sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sport?&rdquo; she repeated, coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quaerts is a Nimrod and a Centaur and a Hercules rolled into
one, aren&rsquo;t you, Quaerts?&rdquo; said Jules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, so you&rsquo;re &lsquo;naming&rsquo; me!&rdquo; said
Quaerts, with a laugh. &ldquo;Where do you really &lsquo;class&rsquo;
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the very few people that I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>really
like!&rdquo; the boy answered, ardently and without hesitation.
&ldquo;Taco, when are you going to teach me to ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you like, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you must fix the day for us to go to the
riding-school. I won&rsquo;t fix a day; I hate fixing days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, shall we say to-morrow? To-morrow will be
Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecile noticed that Jules was still staring at her. She looked at
him back. How was it possible that the boy could like this man! How was
it possible that it irritated her and not him, all that health, that
strength, that power of muscle and rage of sport! She could make
nothing of it; she understood neither Quaerts nor Jules; and she
herself drifted away again into that mood of half-consciousness, in
which she did not know what she thought nor what at that very moment
she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>might say, in which she seemed to be lost and
wandering in search of herself.</p>
<p>She rose, tall, slender and frail in her crape, like a queen who
mourns, with little touches of gold in her flaxen hair, where a small
jet aigrette glittered like a black mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see who&rsquo;s winning,&rdquo; she said
and moved to the card-table in the other room.</p>
<p>She stood behind Mrs. Hoze, appeared to be interested in the game;
but across the light of the candles she peered at Quaerts and Jules.
She saw them talking together, softly, confidentially, Jules with his
arm on Quaerts&rsquo; knee. She saw Jules looking up, as if in
adoration, into the face of this man; and then the boy suddenly threw
his arms around his friend in a wild embrace, while the other pushed
him away with a patient gesture. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40"

<p class="first">Next evening, Cecile revelled even more than usual in
the luxury of being able to stay at home.</p>
<p>It was after dinner; she was sitting on the sofa in her little
boudoir with Dolf and Christie, an arm thrown round each of them,
sitting between them, so young, like an elder sister. In her low voice
she was telling them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judah came near to him, and said, O my Lord, let me abide a
bondman instead of the lad. For our father, who is such an old man,
said to us, when we left with Benjamin, My son Joseph I have already
lost; surely he is torn in pieces by the wild beasts. And if ye take
this also from me and mischief befall him, ye shall bring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>down my
grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. Then (Judah said) I said to our
father that I would be surety for the lad and that I should bear the
blame if I did not bring Benjamin home again. And therefore I pray
thee, O my lord, let me abide a bondman, and let the lad go up with his
brethren. For how shall I go up to my father if the lad be not with
me?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Joseph, mamma, what did Joseph say?&rdquo; asked
Christie.</p>
<p>He had nestled closely against his mother, this poor little slender
fellow of six, with his fine golden hair and his eyes of pale
forget-me-not blue; and his little fingers hooked themselves nervously
into Cecile&rsquo;s gown, rumpling the crape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
stood by him and he caused every man to leave him. And Joseph made
himself known unto his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>brethren. And he wept aloud and said, I am
Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Cecile could not continue the story, for Christie had thrown
himself on her neck in a frenzy of despair and she heard him sobbing
against her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christie! Darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was greatly distressed; she had grown interested in her own
recital and had not noticed Christie&rsquo;s excitement; and now he was
sobbing against her in such violent grief that she could find no word
to quiet him, to comfort him, to tell him that it ended happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Christie, don&rsquo;t cry, don&rsquo;t cry! It ends
happily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Benjamin, what about Benjamin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benjamin returned to his father; and Jacob went down into
Egypt to live with Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child raised his wet face from her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>shoulder and looked at
her deliberately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it really like that? Or are you only making it
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, really, darling. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t cry any
more&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christie grew calmer, but he was evidently disappointed. He was not
satisfied with the end of the story; and yet it was very pretty like
that, much prettier than if Joseph had been angry and put Benjamin in
prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a baby, Christie, to go crying like that!&rdquo; said
Dolf. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecile did not reply that the story had really happened, because it
was in the Bible. She had suddenly become very sad, in doubt of
herself. She fondly dried the child&rsquo;s sad eyes with her
pocket-handkerchief:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, children, bed! It&rsquo;s late!&rdquo; she said,
faintly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p>She put them to bed, a ceremony which lasted a long time; a ceremony
with an elaborate ritual of undressing, washing, saying of prayers,
tucking in and kissing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When, an hour later, she was sitting downstairs again
alone, she realized for the first time how sad she felt.</p>
<p>Ah, no, she did not know! Am&eacute;lie was quite right: one never
knew anything, never! She had been so happy that day; she had found
herself again, deep in the recesses of her secret self, in the essence
of her soul; all day she had seen her dreams hovering about her as an
apotheosis; all day she had felt within her that consuming love of her
children. She had told them stories out of the Bible after dinner; and
suddenly, when Christie began to cry, a doubt had arisen within her.
Was she really good to her little boys? Did she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>not, in
her love, in the tenderness of her affection for them, spoil and weaken
them? Would she not end by utterly unfitting them for practical life,
with which she did not come into contact, but in which the children,
when they grew up, would have to move? It flashed through her mind:
parting, boarding-schools, her children estranged from her, coming home
big, rough boys, smoking and swearing, with cynicism on their lips and
in their hearts: lips which would no longer kiss her, hearts in which
she would no longer have a place. She pictured them already with the
swagger of their seventeen or eighteen years, tramping across her rooms
in their cadet&rsquo;s and midshipman&rsquo;s uniforms, with broad
shoulders and a hard laugh, flicking the ash from their cigars upon the
carpet&#8202;&hellip;. Why did Quaerts&rsquo; image suddenly rise up in
the midst of this cruelty? Was it chance or a logical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>consequence? She could not analyse it; she could
not explain the presence of this man, rising up through her grief in
his atmosphere of antipathy. But she felt sad, sad, sad, as she had not
felt sad since Van Even&rsquo;s death; not vaguely melancholy, as she
so often felt, but sad, undoubtedly sorrowful at the thought of what
must come&#8202;&hellip;. Oh! to have to part with her children! And
then, to be alone&#8202;&hellip;. Loneliness, everlasting loneliness!
Loneliness within herself: that feeling of which Jules had such a
dread! Withdrawn from the world which had no charm for her, sinking
away alone into emptiness! She was thirty, she was old, an old woman.
Her house would be empty, her heart empty! Dreams, clouds of dreaming,
which fly away, which lift like smoke, revealing only emptiness.
Emptiness, emptiness, emptiness! The word each time fell hollowly, with
hammer strokes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>upon her breast. Emptiness, emptiness!&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why am I like this?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;What
ails me? What has altered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never had she felt that word emptiness throb within her in this way:
that very afternoon she had been gently happy, as usual. And now! She
saw nothing before her: no future, no life, nothing but one great
darkness. Estranged from her children, alone within
herself&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She rose with a little moan of pain and walked across the boudoir.
The discreet twilight troubled her, oppressed her. She turned the key
of the lace-covered lamp: a golden gleam crept over the rose folds of
the silk curtains like glistening water. A strange coolness wafted away
something of that scent of violets which hung about everything. A fire
burned on the hearth, but she felt cold. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>She stopped beside the low table; she took up a visiting-card, with
one corner turned down, and read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;T. H. Quaerts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a five-balled coronet above the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quaerts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How short it sounded! A name like the smack of a hard hand. There
was something bad, something cruel in the name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quaerts, Quaerts!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw down the bit of pasteboard, was angry with herself. She
felt cold and not herself, just as she had felt at the Van
Attemas&rsquo; last evening:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not go out again. Never again, never!&rdquo; she said,
almost aloud. &ldquo;I am so contented in my own house, so contented
with my life, so beautifully happy&#8202;&hellip;. That card! Why
should he leave a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>card? What do I want with his
card?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat down at her writing-table and opened her blotting-book. She
thought of finishing a half-written letter to India; but she was in
quite a different mood from when she had begun it. So she took from a
drawer a thick manuscript-book, her diary. She wrote the date, then
reflected a moment, tapping her teeth nervously with the silver
penholder&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>But then, with a little ill-tempered gesture, she threw down the
pen, pushed the book aside and, letting her head fall into her hands on
the blotting-book, sobbed aloud. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50"

<p class="first">Cecile was astonished at her unusually long fit of
abstraction, that it should continue for days before she returned to
her usual condition of serenity, the delightful abode from which she
had involuntarily wandered. But she compelled herself, with gentle
compulsion, to recover the treasures of her loneliness; and she ended
by recovering them. She argued with herself that it would be some years
before she would have to part from Dolf and Christie: there was time
enough to grow accustomed to the idea of separation. Besides, nothing
had altered either about her or within her; and so she let the days
glide slowly over her, like gently flowing water. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>In this way, gently flowing by, a fortnight had elapsed since the
evening which she spent at Dolf&rsquo;s. It was a Saturday afternoon;
she had been working with the children&mdash;she still taught them
herself&mdash;and she had walked out with them; and now she was sitting
in her favourite room waiting for the Van Attemas, who came to tea
every Saturday at half-past four. She rang for the servant, who lighted
the blue flame of methylated spirit. Dolf and Christie were with her;
they sat upon the floor on footstools, cutting the pages of a
children&rsquo;s magazine to which Cecile subscribed for them. They
were sitting quietly, looking very good and well-bred, like children
who grow up in soft surroundings, in the midst of too much refinement,
too pale, with hair too long and too fair, Christie especially, whose
little temples were veined as if with azure blood. Cecile stepped by
them as she went to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52"
name="pb52">52</a>]</span>glance over the tea-table; and the look which
she cast upon them wrapped the children in a warm embrace of devotion.
She was in her calmly happy mood: it was so pleasant to think that she
would soon see the Van Attemas come in. She liked these hours of the
afternoon, when her silver tea-kettle hissed over the blue flame. An
exquisite intimacy filled the room; she had in her long, shapely
feminine fingers that special power of witchery, that gentle art of
handling by which everything over which they merely glided acquired a
look of herself, an indefinable something, of tint, of position, of
light, which the things had not until the touch of those fingers came
across them.</p>
<p>There was a ring. She thought it rather early for the Van Attemas,
but she rarely saw any one else in her seclusion from the outer world;
therefore it must be they. In a second or two, however, Greta
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>entered, with a card: was mevrouw at home and
could the gentleman see her?</p>
<p>Cecile recognized the card from a distance: she had seen one like it
lately. Nevertheless she took it up, glanced at it discontentedly, with
drawn eyebrows.</p>
<p>What an idea, she reflected. Why did he do it? What did it mean?</p>
<p>But she thought it unnecessary to be impolite and refuse to see him.
After all, he was a friend of Dolf&rsquo;s. But such
persistence&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show meneer in,&rdquo; she said, calmly.</p>
<p>Greta went; and it seemed to Cecile as though something trembled in
the intimacy which filled the room, as if the objects over which her
fingers had just passed took on another aspect, a look of shuddering.
But Dolf and Christie had not changed; they were still sitting looking
at the pictures, with occasional remarks falling softly from their
lips. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=

<p class="first">The door opened and Quaerts entered the room. As he
bowed to Cecile, he had his air of shyness in still greater measure
than before. To her this air was incomprehensible in him, who seemed so
strong, so determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will not think me indiscreet, mevrouw, in taking
the liberty to come and call on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Mr. Quaerts,&rdquo; she said, coldly.
&ldquo;Pray sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a chair and placed his tall hat on the floor beside him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not disturbing you, mevrouw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least; I am expecting Mrs. van Attema and her
daughters. You were so kind as to leave a card on me; but, as I dare
say you know, I see nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that, mevrouw. Perhaps it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>to that
very reason that you owe the indiscretion of my visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him coldly, politely, smilingly. There was a feeling
of irritation in her. She felt inclined to ask him bluntly what he
wanted with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; she asked, with her mannerly smile, which
converted her face into a mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid that I might not see you for a very long time;
and I should consider it a great privilege to be allowed to know you
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was in the highest degree respectful. She raised her
eyebrows, as if she did not understand; but the accent of his voice was
so very courteous that she could not even find a cold word with which
to answer him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are these your two children?&rdquo; he asked, with a glance
towards Dolf and Christie. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Get up, boys, and shake hands
with meneer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children approached timidly and put out their little hands. He
smiled, looked at them penetratingly with his small, deep-set eyes and
drew them to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I mistaken, or is the little one very like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both resemble their father,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>It seemed to her she had set a protecting shield around herself,
from which the children were excluded, within which she found it
impossible to draw them. It troubled her that he was holding them so
tight, that he looked at them as he did.</p>
<p>But he released them; and they went back to their little stools,
gentle, quiet, well-behaved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet they both have something of you,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; she said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mevrouw,&rdquo; he resumed, as if he had something important
to say to her, &ldquo;I wish to ask you a direct question: tell me
honestly, quite honestly, do you think me indiscreet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For calling to see me? No, I assure you, Mr. Quaerts. It is
very kind of you. Only &hellip; if I may be candid &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will confess that I fear you will find little in my
house to amuse you. I never see people&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not called on you for the sake of the people I might
meet at your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed, smiling, as if he had paid her a compliment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am very pleased to see you. You are a great
friend of Dolf&rsquo;s, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried each time to say something different from what she
actually did say, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58"
name="pb58">58</a>]</span>to speak more coldly, more aggressively; but
she had too much breeding and could not bring herself to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Dolf and I have known each
other ever so long. We have always been great friends, though we are
quite unlike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of him; he&rsquo;s always very kind to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw him look at the low table and smile. A few reviews were
scattered on it, a book or two. On the top of these lay a little volume
of Emerson&rsquo;s essays, with a paper-cutter marking the page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me you were not a great reader!&rdquo; he said,
mischievously. &ldquo;I should think &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he pointed to the books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, carelessly, with a slight shrug of her
shoulders, &ldquo;a little&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought him very tiresome: why should he remark that she had
hidden herself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>from him? Why, indeed, <i>had</i> she hidden
herself from him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emerson!&rdquo; he read, bending forward a little.
&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he added quickly. &ldquo;I have no right to
spy upon your pursuits. But the print is so large; I read it from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are far-sighted?&rdquo; she asked, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His courtesy, a certain respectfulness, as if he would not venture
to touch the tips of her fingers, placed her more at her ease. She
still disliked him, but there was no harm in his knowing what she
read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fond of reading?&rdquo; asked Cecile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not read much: it is too great a delight for that; nor
do I read everything that appears. I am too hard to please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Emerson?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like his essays very much. They are written with such a
wide outlook. They place one on such a deliciously exalted
level&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She suited her phrase with an expansive gesture; and her eyes
lighted up.</p>
<p>Then she observed that he was following her attentively, with his
respectfulness. And she recovered herself; she no longer wanted to talk
to him about Emerson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very fine indeed,&rdquo; was all she said, to close the
conversation, in the most commonplace voice that she was able to
assume. &ldquo;May I give you some tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, mevrouw; I never take tea at this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you look upon it with so much scorn?&rdquo; she asked,
jestingly.</p>
<p>He was about to answer, when there was a ring at the bell; and she
cried: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Am&eacute;lie entered, with Suzette and Anna. They were a little
surprised to see Quaerts. He said he had wanted to call on Mrs. van
Even. The conversation became general. Suzette was very merry, full of
a fancy-fair, at which she was going to assist, in a Spanish
costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Anna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Auntie!&rdquo; said Anna, shrinking together with
fright. &ldquo;Imagine me at a fancy-fair! I should never sell anybody
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a gift!&rdquo; said Am&eacute;lie, with a
far-away look.</p>
<p>Quaerts rose: he was bowing with a single word to Cecile, when the
door opened. Jules came in, with some books under his arm, on his way
home from school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Auntie? Hallo, Taco, are you going just as I
arrive?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You drive me away,&rdquo; said Quaerts, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Taco, do stay a little longer!&rdquo; begged Jules,
enraptured to see him and lamenting that he had chosen just this moment
to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules, Jules!&rdquo; cried Am&eacute;lie, thinking it was the
proper thing to do.</p>
<p>Jules pressed Quaerts, took his two hands, forced him, like a spoilt
child. Quaerts only laughed. Jules in his excitement knocked a book or
two off the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules, be quiet, do!&rdquo; cried Am&eacute;lie.</p>
<p>Quaerts picked up the books, while Jules persisted in his bad
behaviour. As Quaerts replaced the last book, he hesitated a moment; he
held it in his hand, looked at the gold lettering:
&ldquo;Emerson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecile watched him: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"
name="pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If he thinks I&rsquo;m going to lend it him, he&rsquo;s
mistaken,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>But Quaerts asked nothing: he had released himself from Jules and
said good-bye. With a quip at Jules he left.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Is this the first time he has been to see
you?&rdquo; asked Am&eacute;lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cecile. &ldquo;An uncalled-for civility,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taco Quaerts is always very correct in matters of
etiquette,&rdquo; said Anna, defending him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, this visit was hardly a matter of etiquette,&rdquo;
said Cecile, laughing merrily. &ldquo;But Taco Quaerts seems to be
quite infallible in the eyes of all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He waltzes divinely!&rdquo; cried Suzette. &ldquo;The other
day, at the Eekhofs&rsquo; dance&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suzette chattered on; there was no restraining <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>Suzette
that afternoon; she seemed already to hear the castanets rattling in
her little brain.</p>
<p>Jules had a peevish fit on him, but he remained quietly at a window,
with the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t much care about Quaerts, do you,
Auntie?&rdquo; asked Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find him attractive,&rdquo; said Cecile.
&ldquo;You know, I am easily influenced by my first impressions. I
can&rsquo;t help it, but I don&rsquo;t like those very healthy, robust
people, who look so strong and manly, as if they walked straight
through life, clearing away everything that stands in their way. It may
be morbid of me, but I can&rsquo;t help it; I always dislike any
excessive display of health and physical force. Those strong people
look upon others who are not so strong as themselves much as the
Spartans used to look upon their deformed children.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>Jules could control himself no longer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think that Taco is no better than a Spartan, you know
nothing at all about him,&rdquo; he said, fiercely.</p>
<p>Cecile looked at him, but, before Am&eacute;lie could interpose, he
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taco is the only person with whom I can talk about music and
who understands every word I say. And I don&rsquo;t believe I could
talk with a Spartan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules, how rude you are!&rdquo; cried Suzette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; he exclaimed, furiously, rising
suddenly and stamping his foot. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I
won&rsquo;t hear Taco abused; and Aunt Cecile knows it and only does it
to tease me. And I think it very mean to tease a boy, very
mean&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother and sisters tried to bring him to reason with their
authority. But he caught up his books:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p>He was gone in a moment, furious, slamming the door, which groaned
with the shock. Am&eacute;lie was trembling in every nerve:</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e1144" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Oh, that boy!&rdquo; she hissed out,
shivering. &ldquo;That Jules, that Jules!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Cecile, gently, excusing him.
&ldquo;He is just a little excitable&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had turned rather paler and glanced at her boys, Dolf and
Christie, who had looked up in dismay, their mouths wide open with
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Jules naughty, mamma?&rdquo; asked Christie.</p>
<p>She shook her head, smiling. She felt a strange, an unspeakably
strange weariness. She did not know what it meant; but it seemed to her
as if very distant vistas were opening before her eyes and fading into
the horizon, pale, in a great light. Nor did she know what this meant;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>but she was not angry with Jules and it seemed to
her as if he had lost his temper, not with her, but with somebody else.
A sense of the enigmatical depth of life, the soul&rsquo;s unconscious
mystery, like to a fair, bright endlessness, a far-away silvery light,
shot through her in silent rapture.</p>
<p>Then she laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules is so nice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when he gets
excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anna and Suzette, upset at the incident, played with the boys,
looking over their picture-books. Cecile spoke only to her sister. But
Am&eacute;lie&rsquo;s nerves were still quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you defend those ways of Jules&rsquo;?&rdquo; she
asked, in a choking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it nice of him to stand up for people he likes.
Don&rsquo;t you think so too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Am&eacute;lie grew calmer. Why should she be put out if Cecile was
not? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He
has a good heart I believe, but he is so unmanageable. But, who knows,
perhaps it&rsquo;s my fault: if I understood things better, if I had
more tact&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grew confused; she sought for something more to say and found
nothing, wandering like a stranger through her own thoughts. Then,
suddenly, as if struck by a ray of certain knowledge, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jules is not stupid. He has a good eye for all sorts of
things and for persons too. Personally, I think you judge Taco Quaerts
wrongly. He is a very interesting man and a great deal more than a mere
sportsman. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but there&rsquo;s something
about him different from other people, I can&rsquo;t say exactly
what&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent, seeking, groping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Jules got on better at school. As I say, he is not
stupid, but he learns <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69"
name="pb69">69</a>]</span>nothing. He has been two years now in the
third class. The boy has no application. He makes me despair of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent again; and Cecile also did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Am&eacute;lie, &ldquo;I dare say it is not
his fault! Very likely it is my fault. Perhaps he takes after
me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked straight before her: sudden, irrepressible tears filled
her eyes and fell into her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Cecile,
kindly.</p>
<p>But Am&eacute;lie had risen, so that the girls, who were still
playing with the children, might not see her tears. She could not
restrain them, they streamed down and she hurried away into the
adjoining drawing-room, a big room in which Cecile never sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Amy?&rdquo; Cecile repeated.</p>
<p>She had followed Am&eacute;lie out and now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>threw
her arms about her, made her sit down, pressed Am&eacute;lie&rsquo;s
head against her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know what it is?&rdquo; Am&eacute;lie sobbed.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know&#8202;&hellip;. I am
wretched because of that feeling in my head. It is more than I can bear
sometimes. After all, I am not mad, am I? Really, I don&rsquo;t feel
mad, or as if I were going mad! But I feel sometimes as if everything
had gone wrong in my head, as if I couldn&rsquo;t think. Everything
runs through my brain. It&rsquo;s a terrible feeling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you see a doctor?&rdquo; asked Cecile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, he might tell me I was mad; and I&rsquo;m not. He
might try to send me to an asylum. No, I won&rsquo;t see a doctor. I
have every reason to be happy otherwise, have I not? I have a kind
husband and dear children; I have never had any great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>sorrow.
And yet I sometimes feel profoundly miserable, desperately miserable!
It is always as if I wanted to reach some place and could not succeed.
It is always as if I were hemmed in&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sobbed violently; a storm of tears rained down her face.
Cecile&rsquo;s eyes, too, were moist; she liked her sister, she felt
sorry for her. Am&eacute;lie was only ten years older than she; and
already she had something of an old woman about her, something withered
and shrunken, with her hair growing grey at the temples, under her
veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cecile, tell me, Cecile,&rdquo; she said, suddenly, through
her sobs, &ldquo;do you believe in God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I do, Amy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to go to church sometimes, but it was no
use&#8202;&hellip;. And I&rsquo;ve stopped going&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, I
am so unhappy! It is very ungrateful of me. I have so much to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>be grateful for&#8202;&hellip;. Do you know,
sometimes I feel as if I should like to go to God at once, all at once,
just like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Amy, don&rsquo;t excite yourself so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I wish I were like you, so calm! Do you feel
happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecile smiled and nodded. Am&eacute;lie sighed; she remained lying
for a moment with her head against her sister&rsquo;s shoulder. Cecile
kissed her, but suddenly Am&eacute;lie started:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;the girls might come
in. There &hellip; there&rsquo;s no need for them to see that
I&rsquo;ve been crying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, she arranged her hat before the looking-glass, carefully
dried her veil with her handkerchief:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now they won&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in again. I am quite calm. You&rsquo;re a dear
thing&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>They went back to the boudoir:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, girls, it&rsquo;s time to go home,&rdquo; said
Am&eacute;lie, in a voice which was still a little unsettled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been crying, Mamma?&rdquo; Suzette at once
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma was a bit upset about Jules,&rdquo; said Cecile,
quickly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cecile was alone; the children had gone upstairs to
tidy themselves for dinner. She tried to get back her distant vistas,
fading into the pale horizon; she tried to recover the silvery
endlessness which had shot through her as a vision of light. But
instead her brain was all awhirl with a kaleidoscope of very recent
petty memories: the children, Quaerts, Emerson, Jules, Suzette,
Am&eacute;lie. How strange, how strange life was!&hellip; The outer
life; the coming and going of people about us; the sounds of words
which they utter in strange accents; the endless interchange of
phenomena; the concatenation of those phenomena, one with the other;
strange, too, the presence of a soul somewhere inside us, like a god
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>within us, never to be known in our own essence.
Often, as indeed now, it seemed to Cecile that all things, even the
most commonplace things, were strange, very strange, as if nothing in
the world were absolutely commonplace, as if everything were strange:
the strange form and outward expression of a deeper life that lies
hidden behind everything, even the meanest objects; as if everything
displayed itself under an appearance, a mask of pretence, while the
reality, the very truth, lay underneath. How strange, how strange life
was!&hellip; For it seemed to her as if she, under that very usual
afternoon tea, had seen something very unusual; she did not know what,
she could not express it nor even think it thoroughly; it seemed to her
as if beneath the coming and going of those people something had
glittered: a reality, an ultimate truth under the appearance of that
casual afternoon tea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What <i>is</i> it?&rdquo; she wondered. &ldquo;Am
I deluding myself, or is it so? I feel that it is
so&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all very vague and yet so very clear&#8202;&hellip;. It
seemed to her as though there were a vision, a haze of light behind all
that had happened there, behind Am&eacute;lie and Jules and Quaerts and
the book which he had picked up from the floor and held in his hand for
a moment&#8202;&hellip;. Did that vision, that haze of light mean
anything, or&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>But she shook her head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am dreaming, I am giving way to fancy,&rdquo; she laughed,
within herself. &ldquo;It was all very simple; I only make it complex
because it amuses me to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she had no sooner thought this than she felt something which
denied the thought absolutely, an intuition which should have made her
guess the essence of the truth, but did not quite succeed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>Surely
there was something, something behind it all, hiding away, lurking as
the shadow lurked behind the thing; and the shadow appeared to her as a
vision and haze of light&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Her thoughts still wandered over all those people and finally halted
at Taco Quaerts. She saw him sitting there again, bending slightly
forward in her direction, his hands folded and hanging between his
knees, as he looked up to her. A barrier of aversion had stood between
them like an iron bar. She saw him sitting there again, though he was
gone. That again was past: how quickly everything moved; how small was
the speck of the present!</p>
<p>She rose, sat down at her writing-table and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Beneath me flows the sea of the past; above me
drifts the ether of the future; and I stand midway upon the one speck
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>reality, so small that I must press my feet firmly
together lest I lose my hold. And from the speck of the present my
sorrow looks down upon the sea and my longing up to the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is scarcely life to stand upon this speck, so small that I
hardly appreciate it, hardly feel it beneath my feet; and yet to me it
is the one reality. I am not greatly occupied about it: my eyes only
follow the rippling of those waves towards distant horizons, the
gliding of those clouds towards distant spheres, vague manifestations
of endless change, translucent ephemeras, visible incorporeities. The
present is the only thing that is, or rather that seems to be. The
speck is, or at least appears to be, but not the sea below nor the sky
above, for the sea is but a memory and the air but an illusion. Yet
memory and illusion are everything: they are the wide inheritance of
the soul, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>alone can escape from the speck of the moment to
float upon the sea towards the horizons which retreat, to drift upon
the clouds towards the spheres which retreat and
retreat&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then she reflected. How was it that she had written all this and
why? How had she come to write it? She went back upon her thoughts: the
present, the speck of the present, which was so small&#8202;&hellip;.
Quaerts, Quaerts&rsquo; very attitude, rising up before her just now.
Was he in any way concerned with her writing down those sentences? The
past a sorrow; the future an illusion&#8202;&hellip;. Why, why
illusion?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jules, who likes him,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;And
Am&eacute;lie, who spoke of him &hellip; but she knows
nothing&#8202;&hellip;. What is there in him, what lurks behind him:
his visionary image? Why did he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80"
href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>come here? Why do I dislike him
so? Do I dislike him? I cannot see into his
eyes&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would have liked to do this once; she would have liked to make
sure that she disliked him or that she did not: one or the other. She
was curious to see him once more, to know what she would think and feel
about him then&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>She had risen from her writing-table and now lay at full length on
the sofa, with her arms folded behind her head. She no longer knew what
she dreamt, but she felt peacefully happy. She heard Dolf and Christie
come down the stairs. They came in, it was dinner-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules was really naughty just now, wasn&rsquo;t he,
Mummy?&rdquo; Christie asked again, with a grave face.</p>
<p>She drew the frail little fellow gently to her, took him tightly in
her arms and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>fondly kissed his moist, pale-raspberry lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, really not, darling!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He
wasn&rsquo;t naughty, really&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="first">Cecile passed through the long hall, which was almost
a gallery: footmen stood on either side of the hangings; a hum of
voices came from behind. The train of her dress rustled against the
leaves of a palm; and the sound gave a sudden jar to the strung cords
of her sensitiveness. She was a little nervous; her eyelids quivered
slightly and her mouth had a very earnest fold.</p>
<p>She walked in; there was much light, but soft light, the light of
candles only. Two officers stepped aside for her as she stood
hesitating. Her eyes glanced round in search of Mrs. Hoze; she saw her
standing among two or three of her guests, with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>her grey
hair, her kindly and yet haughty face, rosy and smooth, almost without
a wrinkle.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hoze came towards her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how charming I think it of you not to
have played me false!&rdquo; she said, pressing Cecile&rsquo;s hand
with effusive and hospitable urbanity.</p>
<p>She introduced people to Cecile here and there; Cecile heard names
the sound of which at once escaped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General, allow me &hellip; Mrs. van Even,&rdquo; Mrs. Hoze
whispered and left her, to speak to some one else.</p>
<p>Cecile drew a deep breath, pressed her hand to the edge of her
bodice, as though to arrange something that had slipped from its place,
answered the general cursorily. She was very pale; and her eyelids
quivered more and more. She ventured to throw a glance round the room.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>She stood next to the general, forcing herself to listen, so as not
to give answers that would sound strikingly foolish. She was very tall,
slender, and straight, with her shoulders, white as sunlit marble,
blossoming out of a sombre vase of black: fine, black, trailing tulle,
sprinkled all over with small jet spangles; glittering black on dull
transparent black. A girdle with tassels of jet, hanging low, was wound
about her waist. So she stood, blonde: blonde and black; a little
sombre amid the warmth and light of other toilettes; and, for unique
relief, two diamonds in her ears, like dewdrops.</p>
<p>Her thin su&ecirc;de-covered fingers trembled as she manipulated her
fan, a black tulle transparency, on which the same jet spangles
glittered with black lustre. Her breath came short behind the strokes
of the diaphanous fan as she talked with the general, a spare, bald,
distinguished-looking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85"
name="pb85">85</a>]</span>man, not in uniform, but wearing his
decorations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hoze&rsquo;s guests walked about, greeting one another here and
there, with a continuous hum of voices. Cecile saw Taco Quaerts come up
to her; he bowed before her; she bowed coldly in return, not offering
him her hand. He lingered by her for a moment, spoke a word or two and
then passed on, greeting other acquaintances.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hoze had taken the arm of an old gentleman; a procession formed
slowly. The servants threw back the doors; a table glittered beyond,
half-visible. The general offered Cecile his arm, as she stood looking
behind her with a listless turn of her neck. She closed her eyelids for
a second, to prevent their quivering. Her brows contracted with a sense
of disappointment; but smilingly she laid the tips of her fingers on
the general&rsquo;s arm and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>with her closed fan smoothed away a
crease from the tulle of her train.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">2</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Cecile was seated she found Quaerts sitting on
her right. Then her disappointment vanished, the disappointment which
she had felt at not being taken in to dinner by him; but her look
remained cold, as usual. And yet she had what she wished; the
expectation with which she had come to this dinner was fulfilled. Mrs.
Hoze had seen Cecile at the Van Attemas&rsquo; and had gladly
undertaken to restore the young widow to society. Cecile knew that
Quaerts was a frequent visitor at Mrs. Hoze&rsquo;s; she had heard from
Am&eacute;lie that he was invited to the dinner; and she had accepted.
That Mrs. Hoze, remembering that Cecile had met Quaerts before, had
placed him next to her was easy to understand. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>Cecile was very inquisitive about herself. How would she feel? At
least interested: she could not disguise that from herself. She was
certainly interested in him, remembering what Jules had said, what
Am&eacute;lie had said. She already felt that behind the mere sportsman
there lurked another, whom she longed to know. Why should she? What
concern was it of hers? She could not tell; but, in any case, as a
matter of curiosity, as a puzzle, it awoke her interest. And, at the
same time, she remained on her guard, for she did not think that his
visit to her was strictly in order; and there were stories in which the
name of that married woman was coupled with his.</p>
<p>She succeeded in freeing herself from her conversation with the
general, who seemed to feel called upon to entertain her, and it was
she who spoke first to Quaerts: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you begun to give Jules his riding-lessons?&rdquo; she
asked, with a smile.</p>
<p>He looked at her, evidently a little surprised at her voice and her
smile, which were both new to him. He returned a bare answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mevrouw, we were at the riding-school
yesterday&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She at once thought him clumsy, to let the conversation drop like
that; but he enquired with that slight shyness which became a charm in
him who was so manly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are going out again, mevrouw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought&mdash;she had indeed thought so before&mdash;that his
questions were sometimes questions which people do not ask. This was
one of the strange things about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, simply, not knowing what else to
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said, seeing that his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>words
had embarrassed her a little. &ldquo;I asked, because
&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because?&rdquo; she echoed, with wide-open eyes.</p>
<p>He took courage and explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Dolf spoke of you, he used always to say that you lived
so quietly&#8202;&hellip;. And I could never picture you to myself
returning to society, mixing with many people; I had formed an idea of
you; and it now seems that this idea was a mistaken one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An idea?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will be angry when I tell you. Perhaps, even as
it is, you are none too well pleased with me!&rdquo; he replied,
jestingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the slightest reason to be either pleased or
displeased with you,&rdquo; she jested in return. &ldquo;But tell me,
what was your idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are interested in it?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will answer candidly, yes. But you must be
candid!&rdquo; and she threatened him with her finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I thought of you as a very
cultured woman, as a very interesting woman&mdash;I still think all
that&mdash;<i>and</i> &hellip; as a woman who cared nothing for the
world beyond her own sphere; and this &hellip; this I can no longer
think. And I feel almost inclined to say, at the risk of your looking
on me as very strange, that I am sorry no longer to be able to think of
you in that way. I would almost rather not have met you
here&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed, to soften what might sound strange in his words. She
looked at him, her eyelashes flickering with amazement, her lips
half-opened; and suddenly it struck her that she was looking into his
eyes for the first time. She looked into his eyes and saw that they
were a dark, very dark grey around the black depth of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>the
pupil. There was something in his eyes, she could not say what, but
something magnetic, as though she could never again take away her own
from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange you can be sometimes!&rdquo; she said
mechanically: the words came intuitively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t be angry!&rdquo; he almost implored
her. &ldquo;I was so glad when you spoke kindly to me. You were a
little distant to me when I saw you last; and I should be so sorry if I
put you out. Perhaps I am strange, but how could I possibly be
commonplace with you? How could I possibly, even if you were to take
offence?&hellip; <i>Have</i> you taken offence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to, but I suppose I must forgive you, if only for
your candour!&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;Otherwise your remarks
were anything but gallant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I did not mean it ungallantly.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no doubt!&rdquo; she jested.</p>
<p>She remembered that she was at a big dinner-party. The guests ranged
before and around her; the footmen waiting behind; the light of the
candles gleaming on the silver and touching the glass with all the hues
of the rainbow; on the table prone mirrors, like sheets of water
surrounded by flowers, little lakes amidst moss-roses and lilies of the
valley. She sat silent a moment, still smiling, looking at her hand, a
pretty hand, like a white precious thing upon the tulle of her gown:
one of the fingers bore several rings, scintillating sparks of blue and
white.</p>
<p>The general turned to her again; they exchanged a few words; the
general was delighted that Mrs. van Even&rsquo;s right-hand neighbour
was keeping her entertained and enabling him to get on quietly with his
dinner. Quaerts turned to the lady on his right. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>Both of them were glad when they were able to resume their
conversation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were we talking about just now?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; he replied, mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general interrupted us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were <i>not</i> angry with me!&rdquo; he jested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; she replied, laughing softly, &ldquo;it
was about your idea of me, was it not? Why could you no longer picture
me returning to society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that you had become a person apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what Dolf said, from what I myself thought, when I saw
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why are you now sorry that I am not &lsquo;a person
apart,&rsquo; as you call it?&rdquo; she asked, still laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From vanity; because I made a mistake. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>And yet
perhaps I have not made a mistake&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other; and both of them, although each thought
it in a different way, now thought the same thing, namely, that they
must be careful with their words, because they were speaking of
something very delicate and tender, something as frail as a
soap-bubble, which could easily break if they spoke of it too loudly;
the mere breath of their words might be sufficient. Yet she ventured to
ask:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why &hellip; do you believe &hellip; that perhaps
&hellip; you are not mistaken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know. Perhaps because I wish it so.
Perhaps, too, because it is so true as to leave no room for doubt. Oh,
yes, I am almost sure that I judged rightly! Do you know why? Because
otherwise I should have hidden myself and been commonplace;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>and I find this impossible with you. I have given
you more of myself in this short moment than I have given people whom I
have known for years in the course of all those years. Therefore surely
you must be a person apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;a person apart&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled, he opened his eyes; she looked into them again,
deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand, surely!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Fear for the delicate thing that might break came between them
again. They understood each other as with a freemasonry of feeling. Her
eyes were magnetically held upon his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very strange!&rdquo; she again said,
automatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, calmly, shaking his head, with his eyes
in hers. &ldquo;I am certain that I am not strange to you, even though
you may think so for the moment.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>She was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad to be able to talk to you like this!&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;It makes me very happy. And see, no one knows
anything of it. We are at a big dinner; the people next to us can even
catch our words; and yet there is not one among them who understands us
or grasps the subject of our conversation. Do you know the
reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you; at least, I think it is like this. Perhaps
you know better, for you <i>must</i> know things better than I, you are
so much subtler. I personally believe that each person has a circle
about him, an atmosphere, and that he meets other people who have
circles or atmospheres about them, sympathetic or antipathetic to his
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is pure mysticism!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it is quite simple.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>When the two circles are antipathetic, each repels
the other; but, when they are sympathetic, they glide and overlap in
smaller or larger curves of sympathy. In some cases the circles almost
coincide, but they always remain separate&#8202;&hellip;. Do you really
think this so very mystical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One might call it the mysticism of sentiment. But &hellip; I
have thought something of the sort myself&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I can understand that,&rdquo; he continued, calmly,
as if he expected it. &ldquo;I believe that those around us would not
be able to understand us, because we two alone have sympathetic
circles. But my atmosphere is of a much grosser texture than yours,
which is very delicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent again, remembering her former aversion to him: did
she still feel it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of my theory?&rdquo; he asked. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>She looked up; her white fingers trembled in the tulle of her gown.
She made a poor effort to smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you go too far!&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I rush into hyperbole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would have liked to say yes, but could not:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;not that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I bore you?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him, looked deep into his eyes. She shook her head, by
way of saying no. She would have liked to say that he was too
unconventional just now; but she could not find the words. A faintness
oppressed her whole being. The table, the people, the whole
dinner-party appeared to her as through a haze of light. When she
recovered herself again, she perceived that a pretty woman opposite had
been staring at her and was now looking away, out of politeness. She
did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>know how or why this interested her, but she asked
Quaerts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the lady over there, in pale blue, with the dark
hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw that he started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is young Mrs. Hijdrecht!&rdquo; he said, calmly, a
little distantly.</p>
<p>She too was perturbed; she turned pale; her fan flapped nervously to
and fro in her fingers.</p>
<p>He had named the woman whom rumour said to be his mistress.</p>
</div>

<div class="divHead">

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It seemed to Cecile as though that delicate, frail
thing, that soap-bubble, had burst. She wondered if he had spoken to
that dark-haired woman also of circles of sympathy. So soon as she was
able, Cecile observed Mrs. Hijdrecht. She had a warm, dull-gold
complexion, dark, glowing eyes, a mouth as of fresh blood. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>Her
dress was cut very low; her throat and the slope of her breast showed
insolently handsome, brutally luscious. A row of diamonds encompassed
her neck with a narrow line of white flame.</p>
<p>Cecile felt ill at ease. She felt as if she were playing with fire.
She looked away from the young woman and turned to Quaerts, in
obedience to some magnetic force. She saw a cloud of melancholy
stealing over the upper half of his face, over his forehead and his
eyes, which betrayed a slight look of age. And she heard him say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you care about that lady&rsquo;s name? We were
just in the middle of such a charming
conversation&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She too felt sad now, sad because of the soap-bubble that had burst.
She did not know why, but she felt pity for him, a sudden, deep,
intense pity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We can resume our conversation,&rdquo; she said, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah no, don&rsquo;t let us take it up where we left it!&rdquo;
he rejoined, with feigned airiness. &ldquo;I was becoming
tedious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke of other things. She answered little; and their
conversation languished. They each occupied themselves with their
neighbours. The dinner came to an end. Mrs. Hoze rose, took the arm of
the gentleman beside her. The general escorted Cecile to the
drawing-room, in the slow procession of the others.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">4</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ladies remained alone; the men went to the
smoking-room with young Hoze. Cecile saw Mrs. Hoze come towards her.
She asked her if she had not been bored at dinner; they sat down
together, in a confidential <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>
<p>Cecile made the necessary effort to reply <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>to
Mrs. Hoze; but she would have liked to go somewhere and weep quietly,
because everything passed so quickly, because the speck of the present
was so small. Gone was the sweet charm of their conversation during
dinner about sympathy, a fragile intimacy amid the worldly show about
them. Gone was that moment, never, never to return: life sped over it
with its constant flow, as with a torrent of all-obliterating water.
Oh, the sorrow of it, to think how quickly, like an intangible perfume,
everything speeds away, everything that is dear to us!&hellip;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hoze left her; Suzette van Attema came to talk to Cecile. She
was dressed in pink; and she glittered in all her aspect as if
gold-dust had poured all over her, upon her movements, her eyes, her
words. She spoke volubly to Cecile, telling interminable tales, to
which Cecile did not always listen. Suddenly, through Suzette&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>prattle, Cecile heard the voices of two women
whispering behind her; she only caught a word here and there:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emilie Hijdrecht, you know&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only gossip, I think; Mrs. Hoze does not seem to heed
it&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I know it as a fact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices were lost in the hum of the others. Cecile just caught a
sound like Quaerts&rsquo; name. Then Suzette asked, suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know young Mrs. Hijdrecht, Auntie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there, with the diamonds. You know, they talk about her
and Quaerts. Mamma doesn&rsquo;t believe it. At any rate, he&rsquo;s a
great flirt. You sat next to him, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecile suffered severely in her innermost sensitiveness. She shrank
into herself entirely, doing all that she could to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>appear different from what she was. Suzette saw
nothing of her discomfiture.</p>
<p>The men returned. Cecile looked to see whether Quaerts would speak
to Mrs. Hijdrecht. But he wholly ignored her presence and even, when he
saw Suzette sitting with Cecile, came over to them to pay a compliment
to Suzette, to whom he had not yet spoken.</p>
<p>It was a relief to Cecile when she was able to go. She was yearning
to be alone, to recover herself, to return from her abstraction. In her
brougham she scarcely dared breathe, fearful of something, she could
not say what. When she reached home she felt a stifling heaviness which
seemed to paralyse her; and she dragged herself languidly up the stairs
to her dressing-room.</p>
<p>And yet, on the stairs, there fell over her, as from the roof of her
house, a haze of protecting safety. Slowly she went <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>up,
her hand, holding a long glove, pressing the velvet banister of the
stairway. She felt as if she were about to swoon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Heaven help me &hellip; I am fond of him, I love him, I
love him!&rdquo; she whispered between her trembling lips, in sudden
amazement.</p>
<p>It was as in a rhythm of astonishment that she wearily mounted the
stairs, higher and higher, in a silent surprise of sudden light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am fond of him, I love him, I love him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sounded like a melody through her weariness.</p>
<p>She reached her dressing-room, where Greta had lighted the gas; she
dragged herself inside. The door of the nursery stood half open; she
went in, threw back the curtain of Christie&rsquo;s little bed, dropped
on her knees and looked at the child. The boy partly awoke, still in
the warmth of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106"
name="pb106">106</a>]</span>deep sleep; he crept a little from between
the sheets, laughed, threw his arms about Cecile&rsquo;s bare neck:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mummy dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed him tightly in the embrace of her slender, white arms;
she kissed his raspberry mouth, his drowsed eyes. And meantime the
refrain sang on in her heart, right across the weariness which seemed
to break her by the bedside of her child:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am fond of him, I love him, I love him, I love
him&#8202;&hellip;!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The mystery! Suddenly, on the staircase, it had beamed
open before her in her soul, like a great flower of light, a mystic
rose with glistening petals, into whose golden heart she now looked for
the first time. The analysis to which she was so much inclined was no
longer possible: this was the riddle of love, the eternal riddle,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>which had beamed open within her, transfixing
with its rays the very width of her soul, in the midst of which it had
burst forth like a sun in a universe; it was too late to ask the reason
why; it was too late to ponder and dream upon it; it could only be
accepted as the inexplicable phenomenon of the soul; it was a creation
of sentiment, of which the god who created it would be as impossible to
find in the inner essence of his reality as the God who had created the
world out of chaos. It was light breaking forth from darkness; it was
heaven disclosed above the earth. And it existed: it was reality and
not a fairy-tale! For it was wholly and entirely within her, a sudden,
incontestable, everlasting truth, a felt fact, so real in its ethereal
incorporeity that it seemed to her as if, until that moment, she had
never known, never thought, never felt. It was the beginning, the
opening out of herself, the dawn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108"
href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>of her soul&rsquo;s life, the
joyful miracle, the miraculous inception of love, love focussed in the
midst of her soul.</p>
<p>She passed the following days in self-contemplation, wandering
through her dreams as through a new country, rich with great light,
where distant landscapes paled into a wan radiance, like fantastic
meteors in the night, quivering in incandescence on the horizon. It
seemed to her as though she, a pious and glad pilgrim, were making her
way along paradisaical oases towards those distant scenes, there to
find even more, the goal&#8202;&hellip;. Only a little while ago, the
prospect before her had been narrow and forlorn&mdash;her children gone
from her, her loneliness wrapping her about like a night&mdash;and now,
now she saw stretching in front of her a long road, a wide horizon,
glittering with light, nothing but light&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That <i>was</i>, all that <i>was</i>! It was no fine poets&rsquo;
fancy; it existed, it gleamed in her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>heart like a sacred
jewel, like a mystic rose with stamina of light! A freshness as of dew
fell over her, over her whole life: over the life of her senses; over
the life of outward appearances; over the life of her soul; over the
life of the indwelling truth. The world was new, fresh with young dew,
the very Eden of Genesis; and her soul was a soul of newness, born anew
in a metempsychosis of greater perfection, of closer approach to the
goal, that distant goal, far away yonder, hidden like a god in the
sanctuary of its ecstasy of light, as in the radiance of its own being.

<p class="first">Cecile did not go out for a few days; she saw nobody.
One morning she received a note; it ran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first salute">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Mevrouw</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know if you were offended by my mystical utterances.
I cannot recall distinctly what I said, but I remember that you told me
that I was going too far. I trust that you did not take my indiscretion
amiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a great pleasure to me to come to see you. May I
hope that you will permit me to call on you this afternoon?</p>
<p>&ldquo;With most respectful regards,</p>
<p class="signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Quaerts</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>As the bearer was waiting for a reply, she wrote back in answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first salute">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very pleased to see you this afternoon.</p>
<p class="signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Cecile van
Even.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When she was alone, she read his note over and over again; she
looked at the paper with a smile, looked at the handwriting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;This note &hellip;
and everything that happens. How strange everything is, everything,
everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remained dreaming a long time, with the note in her hand. Then
she carefully folded it up, rose, walked up and down the room, sought
with her dainty fingers in a bowl full of visiting-cards, taking out
two which she looked at for some time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>&ldquo;Quaerts.&rdquo; The name sounded
differently from before&#8202;&hellip;. How strange it all was! Finally
she locked away the note and the two cards in a little empty drawer of
her writing-table.</p>
<p>She stayed at home and sent the children out with the nurse. She
hoped that no one else would call, neither Mrs. Hoze nor the Van
Attemas. And, staring before her, she reflected for a long, long while.
There was so much that she did not understand: properly speaking, she
understood nothing. So far as she was concerned, she had fallen in love
with him: there was no analysing that; it must simply be accepted. But
he, what did he feel, what were his emotions?</p>
<p>Her earlier aversion? Sport: he was fond of sport she
remembered&#8202;&hellip;. His visit, which was an impertinence: he
seemed now to be wishing to atone for it, not to repeat his call
without her permission&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>His mystical
conversation at the dinner-party&#8202;&hellip;. And Mrs.
Hijdrecht&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange he is!&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;I do not
understand him; but I love him, I cannot help it. Love, love: how
strange that it should exist! I never realized that it existed! I am no
longer myself; I am becoming some one else!&hellip; What does he want
to see me for?&hellip; And how singular: I have been married, I have
two children! How singular that I should have two children! I feel as
if I had none. And yet I am so fond of my little boys! But the other
thing is so beautiful, so bright, so transparent, as if that alone were
truth. Perhaps love <i>is</i> the only truth&#8202;&hellip;. It is as
if everything in and about me were turning to crystal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked around her, surprised and troubled that her surroundings
should have remained the same: the rosewood furniture, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>the
folds of the curtains, the withered landscape of the Scheveningen Road
outside. But it was snowing, silently and softly, with great
snow-flakes falling heavily, as though they meant to purify the world.
The snow was fresh and new, but yet the snow was not real nature to
her, who always saw her distant landscape, like a <i>fata morgana</i>,
quivering in pure incandescence of light.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He came at four o&rsquo;clock. She saw him for the
first time since the self-revelation which had flashed upon her
astounded senses. And when he came she felt the singularly rapturous
feeling that in her eyes he was a demigod, that he perfected himself in
her imagination, that everything in him was good. Now that he sat there
before her, she saw him for the first time and she saw that he was
physically <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>beautiful. The strength of his body was exalted
into the strength of a young god, broad and yet slender, sinewed as
with the marble sinews of a statue; and all this seemed so strange
beneath the modernity of his morning coat.</p>
<p>She saw his face completely for the first time. The cut of it was
Roman, the head that of a Roman emperor, with its sensual profile, its
small, full mouth, living red under the brown gold of his curly
moustache. The forehead was low, the hair cut very close, like an
enveloping black casque; and over that forehead, with its single
furrow, hovered sadness, like a mist of age, strangely contradicting
the wanton youthfulness of his mouth and chin. And then his eyes, which
she already knew, his eyes of mystery, small and deep-set, with the
depth of their pupils, which seemed now to veil themselves and then
again to look out. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the strangest thing was that from all his beauty, from all his
being, from all his attitude, as he sat there with his hands folded
between his knees, a magnetism emanated, dominating her, drawing her
irresistibly towards him, as though she had suddenly, from the first
moment of her self-revelation, become <i>his</i>, to serve him in all
things. She felt this magnetism attracting her so violently that every
power in her melted into listlessness and weakness. A weakness as if he
might take her and carry her away, anywhere, wherever he pleased; a
weakness as if she no longer possessed her own thoughts, as if she had
become nothing, apart from <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>She felt this intensely; and then, then came the very strangest
thing of all, as he continued to sit there, at a respectful distance,
his eyes looking up to her in reverence, his voice falling in
reverential accents. This was the very strangest thing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>of
all that she saw him beneath her, while she felt him above her; that
she wished to be his inferior and that he seemed to consider her higher
than himself. She did not know how she suddenly came to realize this so
intensely, but she did realize it; and it was the first pain that her
love gave her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you not to be angry with me,&rdquo; he
began.</p>
<p>There was often something caressing in his voice; it was not clear
and was even now and then a little broken, but this just gave it a
certain charm of quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, I did wrong to pay you that visit. In the
second place, I was ill-mannered at Mrs. Hoze&rsquo;s
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole catalogue of sins!&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely!&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;And you are very good to
bear me no malice.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that is because I always hear so much good about you
at Dolf&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you never noticed anything odd in Dolf?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it never struck you that he has more of an eye for the
great aggregate of political problems as a whole than for the details
of his own surroundings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him, with a smile of surprise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are quite right. You know
him well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have known one another from boyhood! It is curious: he
never sees the things that lie close to his hand; he does not penetrate
them. He is intellectually far-sighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not know his wife, nor his daughters, nor Jules. He
does not see what they have in them. He identifies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>each
of them by means of an image which he fixes in his mind; and he forms
these images out of two prominent characteristics, which are generally
a little opposed. Mrs. van Attema appears to him a woman with a heart
of gold, but not very practical: so much for her; Jules, a musical
genius, but an untractable boy: that settles <i>him</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does not go very deeply into character,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;For there is a great deal more in
Am&eacute;lie&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is quite wrong about Jules,&rdquo; said Quaerts.
&ldquo;Jules is thoroughly tractable and anything but a genius. Jules
is nothing more than an exceedingly receptive boy, with a little
rudimentary talent. And you &hellip; he misconceives you
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely! Do you know what he thinks of you?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks you&mdash;let me begin by telling you
this&mdash;very, very lovable and a dear little mother to your boys.
But he thinks also that you are incapable of growing very fond of any
one; he looks upon you as a woman without passion and melancholy for no
reason, except that you are bored. He thinks you bore
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him in utter dismay and saw him laughing
mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am never bored!&rdquo; she said, joining in his laughter,
with full conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can <i>you</i> know?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel it!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And, what is more, I
know that the basis of your character is not melancholy, not dark, but,
on the contrary, very light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure of that myself,&rdquo; she scarcely
murmured, slackly, with that weakness within her, but happy that he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>should estimate her so exactly. &ldquo;And do
you too,&rdquo; she continued, airily, &ldquo;think me incapable of
loving any one very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that is a matter of which I am not competent to
judge,&rdquo; he said, with such frankness that his whole countenance
suddenly grew younger and the crease disappeared from his forehead.
&ldquo;How can <i>I</i> tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know a great deal about me otherwise,&rdquo; she
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen you so often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barely four times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed brightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a compliment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is meant for one,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You do not
know how much it means to me to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It meant much to him to see her! And she felt herself so small, so
weak; and him so great, so perfect. With what decision <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>he
spoke, how certain he seemed of it all! It almost saddened her that it
meant so much to him to see her once in a while. He placed her too
high; she did not wish to be placed so high.</p>
<p>And that delicate, fragile something hung between them again, as it
had hung between them at the dinner. Then it had been broken by one
ill-chosen word. Oh, that it might not be broken now!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let us talk about yourself!&rdquo; she said,
affecting an airy vivacity. &ldquo;Do you know that you are taking all
sorts of pains to fathom me and that I know nothing whatever about you?
That&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew how much I have given you already! I give myself
to you entirely; from others I always conceal myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am afraid of the others!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> &hellip; afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You think that I do not look as if I could feel afraid?
I have something&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something that is very dear to me and about which I am
very much afraid lest any should touch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is&#8202;&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soul. I am not afraid of your touching it, for you would
not hurt it. On the contrary, I know that it is very safe with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would have liked once more, mechanically, to reproach him with
his strangeness: she could not. But he guessed her thoughts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think me a very odd person, do you not? But how can I be
otherwise with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt her love expanding within her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>heart, widening it to
its full capacity within her. Her love was as a domain in which he
wandered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you yet; I do not know you yet!&rdquo;
she said, softly. &ldquo;I do not see you
yet&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be in any way interested to know me, to see
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you then; I should like to do so; it would be a
great joy to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am listening to you most attentively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One question first: you cannot endure people who go in for
sport?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I like to see the display and development of
strength, so long as it is not too near me. Just as I like to hear a
storm, when I am safely within doors. And I can even find pleasure in
watching acrobats.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=
"#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>He laughed quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless you held my particular predilection in great
aversion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel everything,&rdquo; she said, almost in alarm.
&ldquo;You are a dangerous person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So many think that. Shall I tell you why I believe that you
took a special aversion in my case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you did not understand it in me, even though you may
have observed that physical exercise is one of my hobbies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are right&#8202;&hellip;. But don&rsquo;t let me
talk about myself like this: I would rather talk of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I of you. So be nice to me for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>the
first time in our acquaintance and speak &hellip; of
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed, with a smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not think me tiresome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. You were telling me of yourself. You were
speaking of your love of exercise&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&hellip; Can you understand that there are in me two
distinct individuals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two distinct&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. My soul, which I regard as my real self; and then
&hellip; there remains the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something ugly, something common, something grossly
primitive. In one word, the brute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders lightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dark you paint yourself. The same thing is more or less
true of everybody.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it troubles me more than I can tell you. I suffer;
that brute within me hurts my soul, hurts it even more than the whole
world hurts it. Now do you know why I feel such a sense of security
when I am with you? It is because I do not feel the brute that is in
me&#8202;&hellip;. Let me go on a little longer, let me confess; it
does me good to tell you all this. You thought I had only seen you four
times? But I used to see you so often formerly, in the theatre, in the
street, everywhere. It was always rather strange to me when I saw you
in the midst of accidental surroundings. And always, when I looked at
you, I felt as if I were being lifted to something more beautiful. I
cannot express myself more clearly. There is something in your face, in
your eyes, in your movements, I don&rsquo;t know what, but something
better than in other people, something that addressed itself,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>most eloquently, to my soul only. All this is so
subtle and so strange; I can hardly put it more plainly. But you are no
doubt once more thinking that I am going too far, are you not? Or that
I am raving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I should never have thought you such an idealist,
such a sensitivist,&rdquo; said Cecile, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I leave to speak to you like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked, to escape the necessity of
replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might perhaps fear that I should compromise
you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not fear that for an instant!&rdquo; she replied,
haughtily, as in utter contempt of the world.</p>
<p>They were silent for a moment. That delicate, fragile thing, which
might so easily break, still hung between them, thin, like a gossamer,
lightly joining them together. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>An atmosphere of
embarrassment hovered about them. They felt that the words which had
passed between them were full of significance. Cecile waited for him to
continue; but, as he was silent, she boldly took up the
conversation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I value it highly that you have spoken to me
like this. You are right: you have indeed given me much of yourself. I
want to assure you that whatever you have given me will be quite safe
with me. I believe that I understand you better now that I see you
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want very much to ask you something,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I dare not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled, to encourage him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, really I dare not,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I guess?&rdquo; Cecile asked, jestingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; what do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced round the room until her eye rested on the little table
covered with books. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130"
name="pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The loan of Emerson&rsquo;s essays?&rdquo; she hazarded.</p>
<p>But Quaerts shook his head and laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I bought the volume
long ago. No, no, it is a much greater favour than the loan of a
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be brave then and ask it,&rdquo; Cecile went on, still
jestingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I should not know
how to put my request into words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him earnestly, into his eyes, which gazed steadily
upon her; and then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you want to ask me, but I will not say it.
<i>You</i> must do that: so seek your words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know, will you then permit me to say it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for, if it is what I think, it is nothing that you are
not entitled to ask.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=
"#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet it would be a great favour&#8202;&hellip;. But let me
warn you beforehand that I look upon myself as some one of a much lower
order than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow passed across her face, her mouth had a little contraction
of pain and she pressed him, a little unnerved:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg you, ask. Just ask me simply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a wish, then, that sympathy might be sealed between you
and me. Would you allow me to come to you when I am unhappy? I always
feel so happy in your presence, so soothed, so different from the state
of ordinary life, for with you I live only my better, my real self: you
know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything within her again melted into weakness and slackness; he
was placing her upon too high a pedestal; she was happy, because of
what he asked her, but sad, that he felt himself so much lower than
she. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, nevertheless, with a clear voice.
&ldquo;It shall be as you wish. Let us seal a bond of
sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she gave him her hand, her beautiful, long, white hand, where on
one white finger gleamed the sparks of jewels, white and blue. For a
second, very reverently, he pressed her finger-tips between his
own:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, in a hushed voice, a voice that
was a little broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you often unhappy?&rdquo; asked Cecile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; he replied, almost humbly and as though
embarrassed at having to confess it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, but
it has always been so. And yet from my childhood I have enjoyed much
that people call happiness. But yet, yet &hellip; I suffer through
myself. It is I who do myself the most hurt. And after that the world
&hellip; and I have always to hide myself. To the world, to people
generally I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>only show the individual who rides and fences
and hunts, who goes into society and is very dangerous to young married
women&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed with his bad, low laugh, looking aslant into her eyes;
she remained calmly gazing at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond that I give them nothing. I hate them; I have nothing
in common with them, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too proud,&rdquo; said Cecile. &ldquo;Each of those
people has his own sorrow, just as you have: the one suffers a little
more subtly, the other a little more coarsely; but they all suffer. And
in that they all resemble yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each taken by himself, perhaps. But that is not how I take
them: I take them in the lump and therefore I hate them. Don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that
I am capable of hating.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134"
href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very strong within yourself. You suffice unto
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not that, really not; but you &hellip; you are unjust
towards the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly; but why does it always give me pain? Alone with
you, I forget that it exists, the outside world. Do you understand now
why I was so sorry to see you at Mrs. Hoze&rsquo;s? You seemed to me to
have lowered yourself. And it was because &hellip; because of that
special quality which I saw in you that I did not seek your
acquaintance earlier. The acquaintance was fatally bound to come; and
so I waited&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fate? What would it bring her? thought Cecile. But she could not
pursue the thought: she seemed to herself to be dreaming of beautiful
and subtle things which did not exist for other people, which only
floated between them two. And those beautiful things were already

them as illusions; it was as if she had overtaken the future! For one
brief moment only did this happiness endure; then again she felt pain,
because of his reverence.</p>

<p class="first">He was gone and she was alone, waiting for the
children. She neglected to ring for the lamp to be lighted; and the
twilight of the late afternoon darkened into the room. She sat
motionless, looking out before her at the leafless trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should <i>I</i> not be happy?&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;He is happy with me; he is himself with me only; he cannot be so
among other people. Why then can <i>I</i> not be happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt pain; her soul suffered and it seemed to her as if her soul
were suffering for the first time, perhaps because now, for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>the first time, her soul had not been itself but
another. It seemed to her as if another woman and not she had spoken to
him, to Quaerts, just now. An exalted woman, a woman of illusions; the
woman, in fact, whom he saw in her and not the woman that she was, a
humble woman, a woman of love. Ah, she had had to restrain herself not
to ask him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you speak to me like that? Why do you raise up your
beautiful thoughts to me? Why do you not rather let them drip down upon
me? For see, I do not stand so high as you think; and see, I am at your
feet and my eyes seek you above me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ought she to have told him that he was deceiving himself? Ought she
to have asked him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do I lower myself when I mix with other people? What do
you see in me after all? Behold, I am only a woman, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>a
woman of weakness and dreams; and I have come to love you, I
don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ought she to have opened his eyes and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look upon your own soul in a mirror; look upon yourself and
see how you are a god walking the earth, a god who knows everything
because he feels it, who feels everything because he knows
it&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything?&hellip; No, not everything; for he deceived himself,
this god, and thought to find an equal in her, who was but his
creature.</p>
<p>Ought she to have declared all this, at the cost of her modesty and
his happiness? For his happiness&mdash;she felt perfectly
assured&mdash;lay in seeing her in the way in which he saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me he is happy!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;And sympathy
is sealed between us&#8202;&hellip;. It was not friendship, nor did he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>speak of love; he called it simply
sympathy&#8202;&hellip;. With me he feels only his real self and not
that other &hellip; the brute that is within him!&hellip; The
brute!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there came drifting over her a gloom as of gathering clouds;
and she shuddered at something that suddenly rolled through her: a
broad stream of blackness, as though its waters were filled with mud,
which bubbled up in troubled rings, growing larger and larger. And she
took fear before this stream and tried not to see it; but it swallowed
up all her landscapes&mdash;so bright before, with their luminous
horizons&mdash;now with a sky of ink smeared above, like a foul
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How loftily he thinks, how noble his thoughts are!&rdquo;
Cecile still forced herself to imagine, in spite of it
all&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>But the magic was gone: her admiration of his lofty thoughts tumbled
away into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>an abyss; then suddenly, by a lightning flash
through the night of that inky sky, she saw clearly that this loftiness
of thought was a supreme sorrow to her in him.</p>
<p>It was quite dark in the room. Cecile, afraid of the lightning which
revealed her to herself, had thrown herself back upon the cushions of
the couch. She hid her face in her hands, pressing her eyes, as though
she wished, after this moment of self-revelation, to be blind for
ever.</p>
<p>But demoniacally it raged through her, a hurricane of hell, a storm
of passion, which blew out of the darkness of the landscape, lashing
the tossed waves of the stream towards the inky sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I am unworthy of him &hellip;
unworthy!&hellip;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=

<p class="first">Quaerts lived on the Plein, above a tailor, where he
occupied two small rooms furnished in the most ordinary style. He could
have had much better lodgings if he chose, but he was indifferent to
comfort: he never gave it a thought in his own place; when he came
across it elsewhere, it did not attract him. But it distressed Jules
that Quaerts should live in this fashion; and the boy had long wanted
to improve the sitting-room. He was now busy hanging some trophies on
an armour-rack, standing on a pair of steps, humming a tune which he
remembered from some opera. But Quaerts paid no heed to what Jules was
doing: he lay <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>without moving on the sofa, at full length, in
his pyjamas, unshorn, with his eyes fixed upon the Renascence
decorations of the Law Courts, tracing a background of architecture
behind the leafless trees of the Plein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Taco, will this do?&rdquo; asked Jules, after hanging
an Algerian sabre between two Malay creeses and draping the folds of a
Javanese sarong between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, beautifully,&rdquo; replied Quaerts.</p>
<p>But he did not look at the rack of arms and continued gazing at the
Law Courts. He lay back motionless. There was no thought in him,
nothing but listless dissatisfaction with himself and consequent
sadness. For three weeks he had led a life of debauch, to deaden
consciousness, or perhaps he did not know precisely what: something
that was in him, something that was beautiful but tedious, in ordinary
life. He had begun by shooting over a friend&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>land
in North Brabant. It lasted a week; there were eight of them; sport in
the open air, followed by sporting dinners, with not only a great deal
of wine, certainly the best, but still more geneva, also of the finest,
like a liqueur. Ragging-excursions on horseback in the neighbourhood;
follies at a farm&mdash;the peasant-woman carried round in a barrel and
locked up in the cow-house&mdash;mischievous exploits, worthy only of
unruly boys and savages and ending in a summons before a magistrate,
with a fine and damages. Wound up to a pitch of excitement with too
much sport, too much oxygen and too much drink, five of the pack,
including Quaerts, had gone on to Brussels, where one of them had a
mistress. There they stayed nearly a fortnight, leading a life of
continual excess, with endless champagne and larking: a wild joy of
living, which, natural enough at first, had in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>end
to be screwed up and screwed up higher still, to make it last a couple
of days longer; the last nights spent weariedly over
&eacute;cart&eacute;, with none but the fixed idea of winning, the
exhaustion of all their violence already pulsing through their bodies,
like a nervous relaxation, and their eyes gazing without expression at
the cards.</p>
<p>During that time Quaerts had only once thought of Cecile; and he had
not followed up the thought. She had no doubt arisen three or four
times in his brain, as a vague image, white and transparent, an
apparition which had vanished again immediately, leaving no trace of
its passage. All this time too he had not written to her; and it had
only once struck him that a silence of three weeks, after their last
conversation, must seem strange to her. There it had remained. He was
back now; he had lain three days long at home <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>on
his bed, on his sofa, tired, feverish, dissatisfied, disgusted with
everything, everything; then, one morning, remembering that it was
Wednesday, he had thought of Jules and his riding-lesson.</p>
<p>He sent for Jules, but, too lazy to shave or dress, he remained
lying where he was. And he still lay there, realizing nothing. There
before him were the Law Courts, with the Privy Council adjoining. At
the side he could see the Witte<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2084src"
href="#xd26e2084" name="xd26e2084src">1</a> and William the Silent
standing on his pedestal in the middle of the Plein: that was all
exceedingly interesting. And Jules was hanging up trophies: also
interesting. And the most interesting of all was the stupid life he had
been leading. What a tense effort to lull his boredom! Had he really
amused himself during that time? No; he had made a pretence of being
amused: the episode of the peasant-woman <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>and the
&eacute;cart&eacute; had excited him; the sport was bad, the wine good,
but he had drunk too much of it. And then the filthy champagne of that
wench, at Brussels!&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, what then? He had absolute need of it, of a life like that, of
sport and wild enjoyment; it served to balance the other thing in him,
which became impossible in everyday life.</p>
<p>But why could he not preserve some sort of mean in both? He was
perfectly well-equipped for ordinary life; and with that he possessed
something in addition, something that was very beautiful in his soul:
why could he not remain balanced between those two inner spheres? Why
was he always tossed from one to the other, as a thing that belonged to
neither? How fine he could have made his life with just the least tact,
the least self-restraint! How he might have lived in a healthy delight
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>of purified animal existence, tempered by a
higher joyousness of soul! But tact, self-restraint: he had none of all
this; he lived according to his impulses, always in extremes; he was
incapable of half-measures. And in this lay his pride as well as his
regret: his pride that he felt this or that thing &ldquo;wholly,&rdquo;
that he was unable to compromise with his emotions; and his regret that
he could <i>not</i> compromise and bring into harmony the elements
which for ever waged war within him.</p>
<p>When he had met Cecile and had seen her again and yet once again, he
had felt himself carried wholly to the one extreme, the summit of
exaltation, of pure crystal sympathy, in which the circle of his
atmosphere&mdash;as he had said&mdash;glided in sympathy over hers, in
a caress of pure chastity and spirituality, as two stars, spinning
closer together, might mingle their atmospheres <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>for
a moment, like breaths. What smiling happiness had not been within his
reach, as it were a grace from Heaven!</p>
<p>Then, then he had felt himself toppling down, as if he had rocked
over the balancing-point; and he had longed for earthly pleasures, for
great simplicity of emotion, for primitive enjoyment of life, for flesh
and blood. He now remembered how, two days after his last conversation
with Cecile, he had seen Emilie Hijdrecht, here, in these very rooms,
where at length, stung by his neglect, she had ventured to come to him
one evening, heedless of all caution. With a line of cruelty round his
mouth he recalled how she had wept at his knees, how in her jealousy
she had complained against Cecile, how he had ordered her to be silent
and forbidden her to pronounce Cecile&rsquo;s name. Then, their mad
embrace, an embrace of cruelty: cruelty <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>on her part against
the man whom time after time she lost when she thought him secured for
good, whom she could not understand and to whom she clung with all the
violence of her brutal passion, a purely animal passion of primitive
times; cruelty on his part against the woman he despised, while in his
passion he almost stifled her in his embrace.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Yes, what then? How was he to find the mean between
the two poles of his nature? He shrugged his shoulders. He knew that he
could never find it. He lacked some quality, or a certain power,
necessary to find it. He could do nothing but allow himself to swing to
and fro. Very well then: he would let himself swing; there was no help
for it. For now, in the lassitude following his outburst of savagery,
he began to experience <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>again a violent longing, like one
who, after a long evening passed in a ball-room heavy with the foul air
of gaslight and the stifling closeness and mustiness of human breath,
craves a high heaven and width of atmosphere: a violent longing for
Cecile. And he smiled, glad that he knew her, that he was able to go to
her, that it was now his privilege to enter into the chaste sanctuary
of her environment, as into a temple; he smiled, glad that he felt his
longing and proud of it, exalting himself above other men. Already he
tasted the pleasure of confessing to her honestly how he had lived
during the last three weeks; and already he heard her voice, though he
could not distinguish the words&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Jules climbed down the steps. He was disappointed that Quaerts had
not followed his arranging of the weapons upon the rack and his draping
of the stuffs around them. But he had quietly continued <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>his
work and, now that it was finished, he climbed down and came and sat on
the floor quietly, with his head against the foot of the couch on which
his friend lay thinking. Jules said never a word; he looked straight
before him, a little sulkily, knowing that Quaerts was looking at
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules,&rdquo; said Quaerts.</p>
<p>But Jules did not answer, still staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Jules, what makes you like me so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; answered Jules, with thin lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. How can you know why you are fond of any one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to be so fond of me, Jules. It&rsquo;s not
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will be less so in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jules rose suddenly and took his hat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>He put out his hand;
but Quaerts held him back with a laugh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, scarcely any one is fond of me, except &hellip; you
and your father. Now I know why your father likes me, but not why you
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to know everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so very wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. You&rsquo;ll never be satisfied. Mamma always says
that no one knows anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&hellip; Nothing&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing at all&#8202;&hellip;. Let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you cross, Jules?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I have an engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you wait till I&rsquo;m dressed? Then we can go
together. I am going to Aunt Cecile&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jules objected: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, provided you hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quaerts got up. He now saw the arrangement of the weapons, which he
had entirely forgotten:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it very nicely, Jules,&rdquo; he said, in
an admiring tone. &ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jules did not answer; and Quaerts went through into his
dressing-room. The lad sat down on the sofa, bolt upright, looking out
at the Law Courts, across the bare trees. His eyes filled with great
round tears, which ran down his cheeks. Sitting stiff and motionless,
he wept. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=

<p class="first">Cecile had passed those three weeks in a state of
ignorance which had filled her with pain. She had, it is true, heard
through Dolf that Quaerts was away shooting, but beyond that nothing. A
thrill of joy electrified her when the door behind the screen opened
and she saw him enter the room. He was standing in front of her before
she could recover herself; and, as she was trembling, she did not rise,
but, still sitting, reached out her hand to him, her fingers quivering
imperceptibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been out of town,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been well all this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite well, thank you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>He noticed that she was somewhat pale, that she had a light blue
shadow under her eyes and that there was lassitude in all her
movements. But he came to the conclusion that there was nothing
extraordinary in this, or that perhaps she merely looked pale in the
creamy whiteness of her soft, white dress, like silky wool, even as her
figure became yet slighter in the constraint of the scarf about her
waist, with its long white fringe falling to her feet. She was sitting
alone with Christie, the child upon his footstool with his head in her
lap and a picture-book on his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two are a perfect Madonna and Child,&rdquo; said
Quaerts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Dolf has gone out to walk with his god-father,&rdquo;
she said, looking fondly upon her child and motioning to him
gently.</p>
<p>At this bidding the boy stood up and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>shyly approached
Quaerts, offering him a hand. Quaerts lifted him up and set him on his
knee:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How light he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not strong,&rdquo; said Cecile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You coddle him too much.&rdquo; She laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pedagogue!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;How do I coddle
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always find him nestling against your skirts. He must come
with me one of these days: I should make him do some
gymnastics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules horse-riding and Christie gymnastics!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; sport, in fact!&rdquo; he answered, with a
meaning look of fun.</p>
<p>She glanced back at him; and sympathy smiled from the depths of her
gold-grey eyes. He felt thoroughly happy and, with the child still upon
his knees, said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to confess to you &hellip; Madonna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as though startled, he put the child away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To confess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8202;&hellip;. There, Christie, go back to Mamma; I
mustn&rsquo;t keep you by me any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Christie, with great, wondering eyes,
and caught hold of the cord of Quaerts&rsquo; eyeglass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Child would forgive too easily,&rdquo; said Quaerts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, have I anything to forgive you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be only too happy if you will see it in that
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then begin your confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Child &hellip;&rdquo; he hesitated.</p>
<p>Cecile stood up; she took the child, kissed him and sat him on a
stool by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>window with his picture-book. Then she came back
to the sofa:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not hear&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Quaerts began the story, choosing his words: he spoke of the
shooting, of the ragging-parties and the peasant-woman and of Brussels.
She listened attentively, with dread in her eyes at the violence of
such a life, the echo of which reverberated in his words, even though
the echo was softened by his reverence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is all this a sin calling for absolution?&rdquo; she
asked, when he had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no Madonna, but &hellip; a woman with fairly emancipated
views. If you were happy in what you did, it was no sin, for happiness
is good&#8202;&hellip;. Were you happy, I ask you? For in that case
what you did was &hellip; good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo; he asked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158"
href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&#8202;&hellip;. Therefore I have sinned, sinned against
myself, have I not? Forgive me &hellip; Madonna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was troubled at the sound of his voice, which, gently broken,
wrapped her about as with a spell; she was troubled to see him sitting
there, filling with his body, his personality, his existence a place in
her room, beside her. In a single second she lived through hours,
feeling her calm love lying heavy within her, like a sweet weight;
feeling a longing to throw her arms about him and tell him that she
worshipped him; feeling also an intense sorrow at what he had admitted,
that once again he had been unhappy. Hardly able to control herself in
her compassion, she rose, moved towards him and laid her hand upon his
shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, do you mean all this? Is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>it
all true? Is it true that you have been living as you say and yet have
not been happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly true, on my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were unable to force yourself to be more
moderate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I should like to teach you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I should not like to learn, from <i>you</i>. For it is
and always will be my best happiness to be immoderate also where you
are concerned, immoderate in the life of my real self, my soul, just as
I have now been immoderate in the life of my apparent self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes grew dim; she shook her head, her hand still upon his
shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not right,&rdquo; she said, in deep distress.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a joy &hellip; for both those beings. I have to be like
that, I have to be immoderate: they both demand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is not right,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Pure
enjoyment &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lowest, but also the highest&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shiver passed through her, a deadly fear for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that.
Don&rsquo;t do it. Neither the one nor the other. Really, it is all
wrong. Pure joy, unbridled joy, even the highest, is not good. In that
way you force your life. When you speak so, I am afraid for your sake.
Try to recover moderation. You have so many possibilities of being
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what I mean is that you must not be fanatical. And
&hellip; and also, for the love of God, don&rsquo;t run quite so madly
after pleasure.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>He looked up at her; he saw her beseeching him with her eyes, with
the expression of her face, with her whole attitude, as she stood
bending slightly forward. He <i>saw</i> her beseeching him, even as he
<i>heard</i> her; and then he knew that she loved him. A feeling of
bright rapture came upon him, as though something high were descending
upon him to guide him. He did not stir&mdash;he felt her hand thrilling
at his shoulder&mdash;afraid lest with the smallest movement he should
drive that rapture away. It did not occur to him for a moment to speak
a word of tenderness to her or to take her in his arms and press her to
him: she was so profoundly transfigured in his eyes that any such
profane desire remained far removed from him. And yet he felt at that
moment that he loved her, but as he had never yet loved any one before,
so completely and exclusively, with the noblest elements that lie
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>hidden away in the soul, often unknown even to
itself. He felt that he loved her with new-born feelings of frank youth
and fresh vigour and pure unselfishness. And it seemed to him that it
was all a dream of something which did not exist, a dream lightly woven
about him, a web of sunbeams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madonna!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Forgive
me&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise then&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly, but I shall not be able to keep my promise. I am
weak&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I am! But I give you my promise; and I promise also to
try my utmost to keep it. Will you forgive me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded to him; her smile fell on him like a ray of sunlight.
Then she went to the child, took it in her arms and brought it to
Quaerts: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your arms round his neck, Christie, and give him a
kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the child from her; it threw its little arms about his neck
and kissed him on the forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Madonna forgives me &hellip; and the Child!&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>

<p class="first">They stayed long talking to each other; and no one
came to disturb them. The child had gone back to sit by the window.
Twilight began to strew pale ashes in the room. He saw Cecile sitting
there, sweetly white; the kindly melody of her half-breathed words came
rippling towards him. They talked of many things: of Emerson; of Van
Eeden&rsquo;s new poem in the <i lang="nl">Nieuwe Gids</i>; of their
respective views of life. He accepted a cup of tea, only for the
pleasure of seeing her move with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"
href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>the yielding lines of her
graciousness, standing before the tea-table in the corner. In her white
dress, she had something about her of marble grown lissom with
inspiration and warm life. He sat motionless, listening reverently,
swathed in a still rapture of delight. It was a mood which defied
analysis, without a visible origin, springing from their sympathetic
fellowship as a flower springs from an invisible seed after a drop of
rain and a kiss of the sunshine. She too was happy; she no longer felt
the pain which his reverence had caused her. True, she was a little sad
by reason of what he had told her, but she was happy for the sake of
this speck of the present. Nor did she any longer see that dark stream,
that inky sky, that night landscape: everything that she now saw was
bright and calm. And happiness breathed about her, a tangible
happiness, like a living caress. Sometimes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>they
ceased speaking and both of them looked towards the child, as it sat
reading; or Christie would ask them something and they would answer.
Then they smiled one to the other, because the child was so good and
did not disturb them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only this could continue for ever,&rdquo; he ventured to
say, though still fearing lest a word might break the crystalline
transparency of their happiness. &ldquo;If you could only see into me
now, how all in me is peace. I don&rsquo;t know why, but that is how I
feel. Perhaps because of your forgiveness. Really the Catholic religion
is delightful, with its absolution. What a comfort that must be for
people of weak character!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot think your character weak. And it is not. You
tell me that you sometimes know how to place yourself above ordinary
life, whence you can look down upon its grief as on a comedy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>which makes one laugh sadly for a minute, but
which is not true. I too believe that life, as we see it, is no more
than a symbol of a truer life, concealed beneath it, which we do not
see. But I cannot rise beyond the symbol, while you can. Therefore you
are very strong and feel yourself very great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange, when I just think myself weak and you great and
powerful. You dare to be what you are, in all your harmony; and I am
always hiding and am afraid of people individually, though sometimes I
am able to rise above life in the mass. But these are riddles which it
is vain for me to attempt to solve; and, though I have not the power to
solve them, at this moment I feel nothing but happiness. Surely I may
say that once aloud, may I not, quite aloud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled to him in the bliss which she felt of making him happy.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e2359" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>It is the first time I have felt
happiness in this way,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Indeed it is the
first time I have felt it at all&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t analyse it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need. It is standing before me in all its
simplicity. Do you know why I am happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t analyse, don&rsquo;t analyse,&rdquo; she repeated
in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but may I tell you, without
analysing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;because
&hellip; because I know&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She besought him, very pale, with folded, trembling hands. The child
looked at them; it had closed its book, and come to sit down on its
stool by its mother, with a look of gay sagacity in its pale-blue
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I obey you,&rdquo; said Quaerts, with some
difficulty.</p>
<p>And they were both silent, their eyes <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>expanded as with the
lustre of a vision. It seemed to be gently beaming about them through

<h2 class="main">Chapter X</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This evening Cecile had written a great deal into her
diary; and she now paced up and down in her room, with locked hands
hanging before her and her head slightly bowed and a fixed look in her
eyes. There was anxiety about her mouth. Before her was the vision, as
she had conceived it. He loved her with his soul alone, not as a woman
who is pretty and good, but with a higher love than that, with the
finest nervous fibres of his being&mdash;his real being&mdash;with the
supreme emotion of the very essence of his soul. Thus she felt that he
loved her and in no other way, with contemplation, with adoration. Thus
she felt it actually, through a sympathetic power of divination by
which each of them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"
name="pb170">170</a>]</span>was able to guess what actually passed
within the other. And this was his happiness&mdash;his first, as he
said&mdash;thus to love her and in no other way. Oh, she well
understood him! She understood his illusion, which he saw in her; and
she now knew that, if she really wished to love him for his sake and
not for her own, she must needs appear to be nothing else to him, she
must preserve his illusion of a woman not of flesh, one who desired
none of the earthly things that other women did, one who should be soul
alone, a sister soul to his. But, while she saw before her this vision
of her love, calm and radiant, she saw also the struggle which awaited
her, the struggle with herself, with her own distress: distress because
he thought of her so highly and named her Madonna, the while she longed
only to be lowly and his slave. She would have to seem the woman he saw
in her, for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>the sake of his happiness, and the part would be
a heavy one for her to support, for she loved him, ah, with such
simplicity, with all her woman&rsquo;s heart, wishing to give herself
to him entirely, as only once in her life a woman gives herself,
whatever the sacrifice might cost her, the sacrifice made in ignorance
of herself and perhaps afterwards to be made in bitterness and sorrow!
The outward appearance of her conduct and her inward consciousness of
herself: the conflict of these would fall heavily upon her, but she
thought upon the struggle with a smile, with joy beaming through her
heart, for this bitterness would be endured for <i>him</i>,
deliberately for him and for him alone. Oh, the luxury to suffer for
one whom she loved as she loved him; to be tortured with inner longing,
that he might not come to her with the embrace of his arms and the kiss
of his mouth; and to feel that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172"
href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>the torture was for the sake
of his happiness, his! To feel that she loved him enough to go to him
with open arms and beg for the alms of his caresses; but also to feel
that she loved him more than that and more highly and that&mdash;not
from pride or bashfulness, which are really egoism, but solely from
sacrifice of herself to his happiness&mdash;she never would, never
could, be a suppliant before him!</p>
<p>To suffer, to suffer for him! To wear a sword through her soul for
him! To be a martyr for her god, for whom there was no happiness on
earth save through her martyrdom! And she had passed her life, had
spent long, long years, without feeling until this day that such luxury
could exist, not as a fantasy in rhymes, but as a reality in her heart.
She had been a young girl and had read the poets and what they rhyme of
love; and she had thought she understood it all, with a subtle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>comprehension and yet without ever having had
the least acquaintance with emotion itself. She had been a young woman,
had been married, had borne children. Her married life flashed through
her mind in a lightning-flicker of memory; and she stopped still before
the portrait of her dead husband, standing there on its easel, draped
in sombre plush. The mask it wore was of ambition: an austere, refined
face, with features sharp, as if engraved in fine steel;
coldly-intelligent eyes with a fixed portrait look; thin, clean-shaven
lips, closed firmly like a lock. Her husband! And she still lived in
the same house where she had lived with him, where she had had to
receive her many guests when he was Foreign Minister. Her receptions
and dinners flickered up in her mind, so many scenes of worldliness;
and she clearly recalled her husband&rsquo;s eye taking in everything
with a quick glance of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>approval or disapproval: the
arrangement of her rooms, her dress, the ordering of her parties. Her
marriage had not been unhappy; her husband was a little cold and
unexpansive, wrapped wholly in his ambition; but he was attached to her
after his fashion and even tenderly; she too had been fond of him; she
thought at the time that she was marrying him for love: her dependent
womanliness loved the male, the master. Of a delicate constitution,
probably undermined by excessive brain-work, he had died after a short
illness. Cecile remembered her sorrow, her loneliness with the two
children, as to whom he had already feared that she would spoil them.
And her loneliness had been sweet to her, among the clouds of her
dreaming&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>This portrait&mdash;a handsome life-size photograph; a carbon
impression dark with a Rembrandt shadow&mdash;why had she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>never had it copied in oils, as she had at first
intended? The intention had faded away within her; for months she had
not given it a thought; now suddenly it recurred to her&#8202;&hellip;.
And she felt no self-reproach or remorse. She would not have the
painting made now. The portrait was well enough as it was. She thought
of the dead man without sorrow. She had never had cause to complain of
him; he had never had anything with which to reproach her. And now she
was free; she became conscious of the fact with a great exultation.
Free, to feel what she would! Her freedom arched above her as a blue
firmament in which new love ascended with a dove&rsquo;s immaculate
flight. Freedom, air, light! She turned from the portrait with a smile
of rapture; she thrust her arms above her head as if she would measure
her freedom, the width of the air, as if she would go to meet the
light. Love, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>she was in love! There was nothing but love;
nothing but the harmony of their souls, the harmony of her
handmaiden&rsquo;s soul with the soul of her god, an exile upon earth.
Oh, what a mercy that this harmony could exist between him so exalted
and her so lowly! But he must not see her lowliness; she must remain
the Madonna, remain the Madonna for his sake, in the martyrdom due to
his reverence, in the dizziness of the high place, the heavenly throne
to which he raised her, beside himself. She felt this dizziness
shuddering about her like rings of light. And she flung herself on her
sofa and locked her fingers; her eyelids quivered; then she remained
staring before her, towards some very distant point. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Chapter XI</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Jules had been away from school for a day or two with
a bad headache, which had made him look very pale and given him an air
of sadness; but he was a little better now and, feeling bored in his
own room, he went downstairs to the empty drawing-room and sat at the
piano. Papa was at work in his study, but it would not interfere with
Papa if he played. Dolf spoilt him, seeing in his son something that
was wanting in himself and therefore attracted him, even as possibly it
had formerly attracted him in his wife also: Jules could do no wrong in
his eyes; and, if the boy had only been willing, Dolf would have spared
no expense to give him a careful musical education. But Jules violently
opposed himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178"
name="pb178">178</a>]</span>to anything resembling lessons and besides
maintained that it was not worth while. He had no ambition; his vanity
was not tickled by his father&rsquo;s hopes of him or his appreciation
of his playing: he played only for himself, to express himself in the
vague language of musical sounds. At this moment he felt alone and
abandoned in the great house, though he knew that Papa was at work two
rooms off and that when he pleased he could take refuge on Papa&rsquo;s
great couch; at this moment he had within himself an almost physical
feeling of dread at his loneliness, which caused something to reel
about him, an immense sense of utter desolation.</p>
<p>He was fourteen years old, but he felt himself neither child nor
boy: a certain feebleness, an almost feminine need of dependency, of
devotion to some one who would be everything to him had already, in his
earliest childhood, struck at his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179"
href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>virility; and he shivered in
his dread of this inner loneliness, as if he were afraid of himself. He
suffered greatly from vague moods in which that strange something
oppressed and stifled him; then, not knowing where to hide his inner
being, he would go to play, so that he might lose himself in the great
sound-soul of music. His thin, nervous fingers would grope hesitatingly
over the keys; he himself would suffer from the false chords which he
struck in his search; then he would let himself go, find a single, very
short motive, of plaintive, minor melancholy, and caress that motive in
his joy at possessing it, at having found it, caress it until it
returned each moment as a monotony of sorrow. He would think the motive
so beautiful that he could not part with it; those four or five notes
expressed so well everything that he felt that he would play them over
and over again, until Suzette <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180"
href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>burst into the room and made
him stop, saying that otherwise she would be driven mad.</p>
<p>Thus he sat playing now. And it was pitiful at first: he hardly
recognized the notes; cacophonous discords wailed and cut into his poor
brain, still smarting from the headache. He moaned as if he were in
pain afresh; but his fingers were hypnotized, they could not desist,
they still sought on; and the notes became purer: a short phrase
released itself with a cry, a cry which returned continually on the
same note, suddenly high after the dull bass of the prelude. And this
note came as a surprise to Jules; that fair cry of sorrow frightened
him; and he was glad to have found it, glad to have so sweet a sorrow.
Then he was no longer himself; he played on until he felt that it was
not he who was playing but another, within him, who compelled him; he
found the full, pure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181"
name="pb181">181</a>]</span>chords as by intuition; through the sobbing
of the sounds ran the same musical figure, higher and higher, with
silver feet of purity, following the curve of crystal rainbows lightly
spanned on high; reaching the topmost point of the arch it struck a
cry, this time in very drunkenness, out into the major, throwing up
wide arms in gladness to heavens of intangible blue. Then it was like
souls of men, which first live and suffer and utter their complaint and
then die, to glitter in forms of light whose long wings spring from
their pure shoulders in sheets of silver radiance; they trip one behind
the other over the rainbows, over the bridges of glass, blue and rose
and yellow; and there come more and more, kindreds and nations of
souls; they hurry their silver feet, they press across the rainbow,
they laugh and sing and push one another; in their jostling their wings
clash together, scattering silver down. Now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>they
stand all on the top of the arc and look up, with the great wondering
of their laughing child-eyes; and they dare not, they dare not; but
others press on behind them, innumerous, more and more and yet more;
they crowd upwards to the topmost height, their wings straight in the
air, close together. And now, now they must; they may hesitate no
longer. One of them, taking deep breaths, spreads his flight and with
one shock springs out of the thick throng into the ether. Soon many
follow, one after another, till their shapes swoon in the blue; all is
gleam about them. Now, far below, thin as a thin thread, the rainbow
arches itself, but they do not look at it; rays fall towards them:
these are souls, which they embrace; they go with them in locked
embraces. And then the light: light beaming over all; all things liquid
in everlasting light; nothing but light: the sounds sing the light, the
sounds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>are the light, there is nothing now but the
light everlasting&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up vacantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jules! Jules!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled now, as if awakened from a dream-sleep; he rose, went to
her, to Cecile. She stood in the doorway; she had remained standing
there while he played; it had seemed to her that he was playing a part
of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you playing, Jules?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He was quite awake now and distressed, fearing that he must have
made a terrible noise in the house&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Auntie,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She hugged him, suddenly, violently, in gratitude&#8202;&hellip;. To
him she owed it, the great mystery, since the day when he had broken
out in anger against her&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">&ldquo;Oh, for that which cannot be told, because
words are so few, always the same combinations of a few letters and
sounds; oh, for that which cannot be thought of in the narrow limits of
comprehension; that which at best can only be groped for with the
antenn&aelig; of the soul; essence of the essences of the ultimate
elements of our being!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>She wrote no more, she knew no more: why write that she had no words
and yet seek them?</p>
<p>She was waiting for him and she now looked out of the open window to
see if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>he was coming. She remained there for a long
time; then she felt that he would come immediately and so he did: she
saw him approaching along the Scheveningen Road; he pushed open the
iron gate of the villa and smiled to her as he raised his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran down the steps, into the garden, where he stood. She came
towards him, beaming with happiness and so lovely, so delicately frail;
her blonde head so seemly in the fresh green of May; her figure like a
young girl&rsquo;s in the palest grey gown, with black velvet ribbon
and here and there a touch of silver lace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad that you have come! You have not been to see me
for so long!&rdquo; she said, giving him her hand.</p>
<p>He did not answer at once; he merely smiled. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us sit in the garden, behind: the weather is so
lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They walked into the garden, by the mesh of the garden-paths, the
jasmine-vines starring white as they passed. In an adjoining villa a
piano was playing; the sounds came to them of Rubinstein&rsquo;s
Romance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Cecile, starting. &ldquo;What is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What they are playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of Rubinstein&rsquo;s, I believe,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubinstein?&hellip;&rdquo; she repeated, vaguely.
&ldquo;Yes&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she relapsed into the wealth of memories of &hellip; what? Once
before, in this way, she had walked along these same paths, past
jasmine-vines like these, long, ever so long ago; she had walked
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>with him, with him&#8202;&hellip;. Why? Could
the past repeat itself, after centuries?&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is three weeks since you have been to see me,&rdquo; she
said, simply, recovering herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated throughout his being, seeking an excuse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, softly. &ldquo;You
will forgive me, will you not? One day it was this, another day that.
And then &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. Many reasons together. It is not
good that I should see you often. Not good for you, nor for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us begin with the second. Why is it not good for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let us begin with the first, with what concerns you.
People &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href=
"#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;People are talking about us. I am looked upon as an
irretrievable rake. I will not have your name linked profanely with
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must mind; if not for your own sake
&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped. She knew he was thinking of her boys; she shrugged her
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, why is it not good for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man must not be happy too often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a sophism! Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but I feel I am right. It spoils him; it
is too much for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you happy here, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled and gently nodded yes.</p>
<p>They were silent for very long. They were now sitting at the end of
the garden, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>on a seat which stood in a semicircle of
flowering rhododendrons: the great purple-satin blossoms shut them in
with a tall hedge of closely-clustered bouquets, rising from the paths
and overtopping their heads; standard roses flung their incense before
them. They sat still, happy in each other, happy in the sympathy of
their atmospheres mingling together; yet in their happiness there was
the invincible melancholy which is an integral part of all life, even
in happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I am to tell you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But suppose that I were to see you every day, every moment that
I thought of you&#8202;&hellip;. That would not do. For then I should
become so refined, so subtle, that for pure happiness I should not be
able to live; my other being would receive nothing and would suffer
like a beast that is left to starve. I am bad, I am selfish, to be able
to speak like this, but I must tell <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>you the truth, that
you may not think too well of me. And so I only seek your company as
something very beautiful which I allow myself to enjoy just once in a
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes &hellip; sometimes, too, I imagine that in doing
this I am not behaving well to you, that in some way or other I offend
or hurt you. Then I sit brooding about it, until I begin to think that
it would be best to take leave of you for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still silent; motionless she sat, with her hands lying
slackly in her lap, her head slightly bowed, a smile about her
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak to me,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not offend me, nor hurt me,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Come to me whenever you feel the need. Do always as you think
best; and I shall think that best too: you must not doubt that.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I should so much like to know in what way you like
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way? Surely, as a Madonna does a sinner who repents
and gives her his soul,&rdquo; she said, archly. &ldquo;Am I not a
Madonna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you content to be so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you be so ignorant about women as not to know how every
one of us has a longing to solace and relieve, in fact, to play at
being a Madonna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not speak like that,&rdquo; he said, with pain in his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am speaking seriously&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her; a doubt rose within him, but she smiled to him; a
calm glory was about her; she sat amidst the bouquets of the
rhododendrons as in the blossoming tenderness of one great mystic
flower. The wound of his doubt was soothed with balsam. He surrendered
himself wholly to his happiness; an atmosphere wafted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>about him of the sweet calm of life, an
atmosphere in which life becomes dispassionate and restful and smiling,
like the air which is rare about the gods. It began to grow dark; a
violet dusk fell from the sky like crape falling upon crape; quietly
the stars lighted up. The shadows in the garden, between the shrubs
among which they sat, flowed into one another; the piano in the next
villa had stopped. And happiness drew a veil between his soul and the
outside world: the garden with its design of plots and paths; the villa
with curtains at its windows and its iron gate; the road behind, with
the rattle of carriages and trams. All this withdrew itself far back;
all ordinary life retreated far from him; vanishing behind the veil, it
died away. It was no dream nor conceit: reality to him was the
happiness that had come while the world died away; the happiness that
was rare, invisible, intangible, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193"
href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>coming from the love which
alone is sympathy, calm and without passion, the love which exists
purely of itself, without further thought either of taking anything or
even of giving anything, the love of the gods, which is the soul of
love itself. High he felt himself: the equal of the illusion which he
had of her, which she wished to be for his sake, of which he also was
now absolutely certain. For he could not know that what had given him
happiness&mdash;his illusion&mdash;so perfect, so crystal-clear, might
cause her some sort of grief; he could not at this moment penetrate
without sin into the truth of the law which insists on equilibrium,
which takes away from one what it offers to another, which gives
happiness and grief together; he could not know that, if happiness was
with him, with her there was anguish, anguish in that she had to make a
pretence and deceive him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>for his own sake, anguish in that
she wanted what was earthly, that she craved for what was earthly, that
she yearned for earthly pleasures!&hellip; And still less could he know
that, notwithstanding all this, there was nevertheless voluptuousness
in her anguish: that to suffer through him, to suffer for him made of
her anguish all voluptuousness.</p>

<p class="first">It was dark and late; and they were still sitting
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go for a walk?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He hesitated, with a smile; but she repeated her suggestion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, if you care to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he could no longer refuse.</p>
<p>They rose and went along by the back of the house; and Cecile said
to the maid, whom she saw sitting with her needle-work by the
kitchen-door: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Greta, fetch me my little black hat, my black-lace shawl and
a pair of gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant rose and went into the house. Cecile noticed how a
trifle of shyness was emphasized in Quaerts&rsquo; hesitation, now that
they stood loitering, waiting among the flower-beds. She smiled,
plucked a rose and placed it in her waist-band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the boys gone to bed?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, still smiling, &ldquo;long
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant returned; Cecile put on the little black hat, threw the
lace about her neck, but refused the gloves which Greta offered
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not these; get me a pair of grey
ones&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant went into the house again; and as Cecile looked at
Quaerts her gaiety increased. She gave a little laugh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she asked, mischievously,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>knowing perfectly well what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing!&rdquo; he said, vaguely, and waited
patiently until Greta returned.</p>
<p>Then they went through the garden-gate into the Woods. They walked
slowly, without speaking; Cecile played with her long gloves, not
putting them on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really &hellip;&rdquo; he began, hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know; I told you the other day: it&rsquo;s not
right&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we are doing now. You risk too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much, with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any one were to see us&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wilful; you know quite well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clinched her eyes; her mouth grew <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>serious; she
pretended to be a little angry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, you mustn&rsquo;t be anxious if <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not.
I am doing no harm. Our walks are not secret: Greta at least knows
about them. And, besides, I am free to do as I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault: the first time we went for a walk in the
evening, it was at my request&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do penance and be good; come now, without scruple, at
<i>my</i> request,&rdquo; she said, with mock emphasis.</p>
<p>He yielded, feeling far too happy to wish to make any sacrifice to a
convention which at that moment did not exist.</p>
<p>They walked on silently. Cecile&rsquo;s sensations always came to
her in shocks of surprise. So it had been when Jules had grown suddenly
angry with her; so also, midway on the stair, after that conversation
at dinner of circles of sympathy. And now, precisely in the same way,
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>the shock of sudden revelation, came this new
sensation, that after all she was not suffering so seriously as she had
at first thought; that her agony, being a voluptuousness, could not be
a martyrdom; that she was happy, that happiness had come about her in
the fine air of his atmosphere, because they were together,
together&#8202;&hellip;. Oh, why wish for anything more, above all for
things less pure? Did he not love her and was not his love already a
fact and was not his love earthly enough for her, now that it was a
fact? Did he not love her with a tenderness which feared for anything
that might trouble her in the world, through her ignoring that world
and wandering about with him alone in the dark? Did he not love her
with tenderness, but also with the lustre of his soul&rsquo;s divinity,
calling her Madonna and by this title&mdash;unconsciously, perhaps, in
his simplicity&mdash;making her the equal of all that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>was
divine in him? Did he not love her? Heavens above, did he not love her?
Well, what did she want more? No, no, she wanted nothing more: she was
happy, she shared happiness with him; he gave it to her just as she
gave it to him; it was a sphere that moved with them wherever they
went, seeking their way along the darkling paths of the Woods, she
leaning on his arm, he leading her, for she could see nothing in the
dark, which yet was not dark, but pure light of their happiness. And so
it was as if it were not evening, but day, noonday, noonday in the
night, hour of light in the dusk!</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And the darkness was light; the night dawned with
light which beamed on every side. Calmly it beamed, the light, like one
solitary planet, beaming with the soft radiance of purity, bright in a
heaven of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>still, white, silver light, a heaven where they
walked along milky ways of light and music; it beamed and sounded
beneath their feet; it welled in seas of ether high above their heads
and beamed and sounded there, high and clear. And they were alone in
their heaven, in their infinite heaven, which was as space, endless
beneath them and above and around them, with endless spaces of light
and music, of light that was music. Their heaven lay eternal on every
side with blissful vistas of white radiance, fading away in lustre and
vanishing landscapes, like oases of flowers and plants beside waters of
light, still and clear and hushed with peace. For its peace was the
ether in which all desire is dissolved and becomes transparent and
crystal; and their life was a limpid existence in unruffled peace; they
walked on, in heavenly sympathy of fellowship, close together, hemmed
in one narrow circle, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href=
"#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>circle of radiance which embraced
them both. Barely was there a recollection in them of the world which
had died out in the glitter of their heaven; there was naught in them
but the ecstasy of their love, which had become their soul, as if they
no longer had any soul, as if they were only love; and, when they
looked about them and into the light, they saw that their heaven, in
which their happiness was the light, was nothing but their love, and
they saw that the landscapes&mdash;the flowers and plants by waters of
light&mdash;were nothing but their love and that the endless space, the
eternities of light and space, of spaces full of light and music,
stretching on every hand, beneath them and above and around them, that
all this was nothing but their love, which had grown into heaven and
happiness.</p>
<p>And now they came into the very midst, to the very sun-centre, the
very goal which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202"
name="pb202">202</a>]</span>Cecile had once foreseen, concealed in the
distance, in the irradiance of innate divinity. Up to the very goal
they stepped; and on every side it shot its endless rays into each and
every eternity, as if their love were becoming the centre of the
universe&#8202;&hellip;</p>

<p class="first">But they sat on a bench, in the dark, not knowing that
it was dark, for their eyes were full of the light. They sat against
each other, silently at first, till, remembering that he had a voice
and could still speak words, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never lived through such a moment as this. I forget
where we are and who we are and that we are human. We were, were we
not? I seem to remember that we once were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we are that no longer,&rdquo; she said, smiling; and
her eyes, grown <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203"
name="pb203">203</a>]</span>big, looked into the darkness that was
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we were human, suffering and desiring, in a world where
certainly much was beautiful, but where much also was ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why speak of that now?&rdquo; she asked; and her voice
sounded to herself as coming from very far and low beneath her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seemed to remember it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will do so too. But may I not thank you in human
speech for lifting me above humanity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I done so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. May I thank you for it &hellip; on my knees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knelt down and reverently took her hands. He could just
distinguish the outline of her figure, seated motionless and still upon
the bench; above them was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>pearl-grey twilight of stars,
between the black boughs. She felt her hands in his and then his mouth,
his kiss, upon her hand. Very gently, she released herself; and then,
with a great soul of modesty, full of desireless happiness, very gently
she bent her arms about his neck, took his head against her and kissed
him on the forehead:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, I thank you too!&rdquo; she whispered,
rapturously.</p>
<p>He was still; and she held him fast in her embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for teaching me this and
how to be happy as we are and no otherwise. You see, when I still lived
and was human, when I was a woman, I thought that I had lived before I
met you, for I had had a husband and I had children of whom I was very
fond. But from you I first learnt to live, to live without egoism and
without desire; I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205"
name="pb205">205</a>]</span>learnt that from you this evening or
&hellip; this day, which is it? You have given me life and happiness
and everything. And I thank you, I thank you! You see, you are so great
and so strong and so clear and you have borne me towards your own
happiness, which should also be mine, but it was so far above me that,
without you, I should never have attained it! For there was a barrier
for me which did not exist for you. You see, when I was still
human&rdquo;&mdash;and she laughed, clasping him more
tightly&mdash;&ldquo;I had a sister; and she too felt that there was a
barrier between her happiness and herself; and she felt that she could
not surmount this barrier and was so unhappy because of it that she
feared lest she should go mad. But I, I do not know: I dreamed, I
thought, I hoped, I waited, oh, I waited; and then you came; and you
made me understand at once that you could be no man, no husband
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>for me, but that you could be more for me: my
angel, O my deliverer, who would take me in his arms and bear me over
the barrier into his own heaven, where he himself was god, and make me
his Madonna! Oh, I thank you, I thank you! I do not know how to thank
you; I can only say that I love you, that I adore you, that I lay
myself at your feet. Remain as you are and let me adore you, while you
kneel where you are. I may adore you, may I not, while you yourself are
kneeling? You see, I too must confess, as you used to do,&rdquo; she
continued, for now she could not but confess. &ldquo;I have not always
been straightforward with you; I have sometimes pretended to be the
Madonna, knowing all the time that I was but an ordinary woman, a woman
who frankly loved you. But I deceived you for your own happiness, did I
not? You wished me so, you were happy when I was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>so
and no otherwise. And now, now too you must forgive me, because now I
need no longer pretend, because that is past and has died away, because
I myself have died away from myself, because now I am no longer a
woman, no longer human for myself, but only what you wish me to be: a
Madonna and your creature, an atom of your own essence and divinity. So
will you forgive me the past? May I thank you for my happiness, for my
heaven, my light, O my master, for my joy, my great, my immeasurable
joy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and sat beside her, taking her gently in his arms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, laying her head on his shoulder in a
giddiness of light. &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered; and he asked again, &ldquo;And do
you desire &hellip; nothing more?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing!&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;I want nothing but
this, nothing but what is mine, oh, nothing, nothing more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear it to me &hellip; by something sacred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear it to you &hellip; by yourself!&rdquo; she
declared.</p>
<p>He pressed her head to his shoulder again. He smiled; and she did
not see that there was sadness in his laugh, for she was blinded with
light.</p>

<p class="first">They were long silent, sitting there. She remembered
having said many things, she no longer knew what. About her she saw
that it was dark, with only that pearl-grey twilight of stars above
their heads, between the black boughs. She felt that she was lying with
her head on his shoulder; she heard his breath. A sort of chill crept
down her shoulders, notwithstanding <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>the warmth of his
embrace; she drew the lace closer about her throat and felt that the
bench on which they sat was moist with dew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, I love you so, you make me so happy,&rdquo; she
repeated.</p>
<p>He was silent; he pressed her to him very gently, with sheer
tenderness. Her last words still sounded in her ears after she had
spoken them. Then she was bound to acknowledge to herself that they had
not been spontaneous, like all that she had told him before, as he
knelt before her with his head at her breast. She had spoken them to
break the silence: formerly that silence had never troubled her; why
should it now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said gently; and even yet she did not hear
the sadness of his voice, in this single word.</p>
<p>They rose and walked on. It came to him that it was late, that they
must return <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>by the same path; beyond that, his thoughts were
sorrowful with many things which he could not have expressed; a poor
twilight had come about him, after the blinding light of their heaven
of but now. And he had to be cautious: it was very dark here; and he
could only just see the path, lying very pale and undecided at their
feet; they brushed against the trunks of the trees as they passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see nothing,&rdquo; said Cecile, laughing. &ldquo;Can
you see the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rely upon me: I can see quite well in the dark,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;I have eyes like a lynx&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step by step they went on and she felt a sweet joy in being guided
by him; she clung close to his arm, saying laughingly that she was
afraid and that she would be terrified if he were suddenly to leave
hold of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose I were suddenly to run <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>away
and leave you alone?&rdquo; said Quaerts, jestingly.</p>
<p>She laughed; she besought him with a laugh not to do so. Then she
was silent, angry with herself for laughing; a burden of sadness bore
her down because of her jesting and laughter. She felt as if she were
unworthy of that into which, in radiant light, she had just been
received.</p>
<p>And he too was filled with sadness: the sadness of having to lead
her through the dark, by invisible paths, past rows of invisible
tree-trunks which might graze and wound her; of having to lead her
through a dark wood, through a black sea, through an ink-dark sphere,
when they were returning from a heaven where all had been light and all
happiness, without sadness or darkness.</p>
<p>And so they were silent in that sadness, until they reached the
highroad, the old Scheveningen Road. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>They approached the villa. A tram went by; two or three people
passed on foot; it was a fine evening. He brought her home and waited
until the door opened to his ring. The door remained unopened; meantime
he pressed her hand tightly and hurt her a little, involuntarily. Greta
must have fallen asleep, she thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ring again, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rang again, louder this time; after a moment, the door opened.
She gave him her hand once more, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, mevrouw,&rdquo; he said, taking her fingers
respectfully and raising his hat.</p>
<p>Now, now she could hear the sound of his voice, with its note of
sadness&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=

<p class="first">Then she knew, next day, when she sat alone, wrapped
in reflection, that the sphere of happiness, the highest and brightest,
may not be trod; that it may only beam upon us as a sun; and that we
may not enter into it, into the sacred sun-centre. They had done
that&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Listless she sat, with her children by her side, Christie looking
pale and languid. Yes, she spoiled them; but how could she change
herself?</p>
<p>Weeks passed; and Cecile heard nothing from Quaerts. It was always
so: after he had been with her, weeks would drag by without her ever
seeing him. For he was much too happy with her, it was more than
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>he could bear. He looked upon her society as a
rare pleasure to be very jealously indulged. And she, she loved him
simply, with the innermost essence of her soul, loved him frankly, as a
woman loves a man&#8202;&hellip;. She always wanted him, every day,
every hour, at every pulse of her life.</p>
<p>Then she met him by chance, at Scheveningen, where she had gone one
evening with Am&eacute;lie and Suzette. Then once again at a reception
at Mrs. Hoze&rsquo;s. He seemed shy with her; and a certain pride in
her kept her from asking him to call. Yes, something was changed in
what had been woven between them. But she suffered sorely, suffered
also because of that foolish pride, because she had not humbly begged
him to come to her. Was he not her god? Whatever he did was good.</p>
<p>So she did not see him for weeks and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>weeks. Life went on:
each day she had her little occupations, in her household, with her
children; Mrs. Hoze reproached her for her withdrawal from society and
she began to think more about her friends, to please Mrs. Hoze, who had
asked this of her. There were flashes in her memory; in those flashes
she saw the dinner-party, their conversations and walks, all her love
for him, all his reverence for her whom he called Madonna; their last
evening of light and ecstasy. Then she smiled; and the smile itself
beamed over her anguish, her anguish in that she no longer saw him, in
that she felt proud and cherished a little inward bitterness. Yet all
things must be well, as he wished them to be.</p>
<p>Oh, the evenings, the summer evenings, cooling after the warm days,
the evenings when she sat alone, staring out from her room, where the
onyx lamp burnt with a subdued flame, staring out of the open
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>windows at the trams which, with their tinkling
bells, came and went to Scheveningen, full, full of people! Waiting,
the endless long waiting, evening after evening in solitude, after the
children had gone to bed! Waiting, when she simply sat still, staring
fixedly before her, looking at the trams, the tedious, everlasting
trams! Where was her modulated joy of dreaming happiness? And where,
where was her radiant happiness? Where was her struggle within herself
between what she was and what he saw in her? This struggle no longer
existed, this struggle also had been overcome; she no longer felt the
force of passion; she only longed to see him come as he had always
come, as he no longer came. Why did he not come? Happiness palled;
people were talking about them&#8202;&hellip;. It was not right that
they should see much of each other&mdash;he had said so the evening
before that highest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217"
name="pb217">217</a>]</span>happiness&mdash;not good for him and not
good for her.</p>
<p>So she sat and thought; and great silent tears fell from her eyes,
for she knew that, though he remained away partly for his own sake, it
was above all for hers that he did not come. What had she not said to
him that evening on the bench in the Woods, when her arms were about
his neck! Oh, she should have been silent, she felt it now! She should
not have uttered her rapture, but have enjoyed it secretly within
herself; she should have let him utter himself: she herself should have
remained his Madonna. But she had been too full, too happy; and in that
over-brimming happiness she had been unable to be other than true and
clear as a bright mirror.</p>
<p>He had glanced into her and read her entirely: she knew that, she
was certain of it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218"
name="pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>He knew now in what manner she loved him; she herself had revealed
it to him. But, at the same time, she had made known to him that this
was all past, that she was now what he wished her to be. And this had
been true then, clear at that time and true&#8202;&hellip;. But now?
Does ecstasy endure only for one moment and did he know it? Did he know
that her soul&rsquo;s flight had reached its limit and must now descend
again to a commoner sphere? Did he know that she loved him again now,
quite ordinarily, with all her being, wholly and entirely, no longer as
widely as the heavens, only as widely as her arms could reach out and
embrace? And could he not return this love, this so petty love of hers,
and was that why he did not come to her?</p>

<p class="first">Then she received his letter: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me if I put off from day to day coming to see you;
forgive me if even to-day I cannot decide to come and if I write to you
instead. Forgive me if I even venture to ask you whether it may not be
necessary that we see each other no more. If I hurt you and offend you,
if I&mdash;which may God forbid&mdash;cause you pain, forgive me,
forgive me! Perhaps I procrastinated a little from indecision, but much
more because I considered that I had no other choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been between our two lives, between our two souls,
a rare moment of happiness which was a special boon, a special grace of
heaven. Do you not think so too? Oh, if only I had the words to tell
you how grateful I am in my innermost soul for that happiness! If later
I ever look back upon my life, I shall always see that happiness
gleaming in between the ugliness and the blackness, like a star
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>of light. We received it as such, as a gift of
light. And I venture to ask you if that gift is not a thing for you and
me to keep sacred?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we do that if I continue to see you? You, yes, I have no
doubt of you: you will be strong to keep it sacred, our sacred
happiness, especially because you have already had your struggle, as
you confided to me on that sacred evening. But I, can I too be strong,
especially now that I know that you have been through the struggle? I
doubt myself, I doubt my own force; I am afraid of myself. There is
cruelty in me, a love of destruction, something of a savage. As a boy I
took pleasure in destroying beautiful things, in breaking and soiling
them. The other day, Jules brought me some roses to my room; in the
evening, as I sat alone, thinking of you and of our
happiness&mdash;yes, at that very moment&mdash;my fingers began to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>fumble with a rose whose petals were loose; and,
when I saw that one rose dispetalled, there came a cruel frenzy within
me to tear and destroy them all; and I rumpled every one of them. I
only give you a small instance, because I do not wish to give you
larger instances, from vanity, lest you should know how bad I am. I am
afraid of myself. If I saw you again and again and yet again, what
should I begin to feel and think and wish, unconsciously? Which would
be the stronger, my soul or the beast that is in me? Forgive me for
laying bare my dread before you and do not despise me for it. Up to the
present I have <i>not</i> attempted a struggle, in the sacred world of
our happiness. I saw you, I saw you often before I knew you; I guessed
you as you were; I was permitted to speak to you; it was given me to
love you with my soul alone: I beseech you, let it remain so.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>Let me continue to keep my happiness like this,
to keep it sacred, a thousand times sacred. I think it worth while to
have lived, now that I have known <i>that</i>: happiness, the highest.
And I am afraid of the struggle which would probably come and pollute
that sacred thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you believe me when I swear to you that I have reflected
deeply on all this? Will you believe me when I swear to you that I
suffer at the thought of never being permitted to see you again? And,
above all, will you forgive me when I swear to you that I am acting in
this way because I think that I am doing right? Oh, I am grateful to
you and I love you as a soul of light alone, of nothing but light!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am wrong to send you this letter. I do not know.
Perhaps presently I will tear up what I have
written&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>Yet he had sent her the letter.</p>
<p>There was great bitterness within her. She had struggled once, had
conquered herself and, in a sacred moment, had confessed both struggle
and conquest; she knew that fate had compelled her to do so; she now
knew what she would lose through her confession. For a short moment, a
single evening perhaps, she had been worthy of her god and his equal.
Now she was so no longer; for this reason also she felt bitter. And she
felt bitterest of all because the thought dared to rise within her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A god! Is he a god? Is a god afraid of the
struggle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her threefold bitterness changed to despair, black despair, a
night which her eyes sought to penetrate in order to see something
where they saw nothing, nothing; and she moaned low and wrung her
hands, sinking into a heap before the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>window and staring at
the trams which, with the tinkling of their bells, ran pitilessly to
and fro. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">She shut herself up; she saw little of her children;
she told her friends that she was ill. She was at home to no visitors.
She guessed intuitively that people in their circles were speaking of
Quaerts and herself. Life hung dull about her in a closely-woven web of
tiresome, tedious meshes; and she remained motionless in her corner, to
avoid entangling herself in those meshes. Once Jules forced his way to
her; he went upstairs, in spite of Greta&rsquo;s protests; he sought
her in the little boudoir and, not finding her, went resolutely to her
bedroom. He knocked without receiving a reply, but entered
nevertheless. The room was half in darkness, for she kept the blinds
lowered; in the shadow of the canopy which rose above the bedstead,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>with its hangings of old-blue brocade, Cecile
lay sleeping. Her tea-gown was open over her breast; the train trailed
from the bed and lay creased over the carpet; her hair spread loosely
over the pillows; one of her hands was clutching nervously at the tulle
bed-curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auntie!&rdquo; cried Jules. &ldquo;Auntie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook her by the arm; and she woke heavily, with heavy, blue-girt
eyes. She did not recognize him at first and thought that he was little
Dolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Auntie; Jules&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew him now, asked how he came there, what was the matter and
if he did not know that she was ill?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew, but I wanted to speak to you. I came to speak to you
about &hellip; him&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Taco. He asked me to tell you. He couldn&rsquo;t write
to you, he said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227"
name="pb227">227</a>]</span>He is going on a long journey with his
friend from Brussels; he will be away a long time and he would like
&hellip; he would like to take leave of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To take leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and he told me to ask you if he might see you once
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had half-raised herself and was looking at Jules with a vacant
air. In an instant the memory ran through her brain of the long look
which Jules had directed on her so strangely when she saw Quaerts for
the first time and spoke to him coolly and distantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you many relations in The Hague?&hellip; You have no
occupation, I believe?&hellip; Sport?&hellip; Oh!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came the memory of Jules playing the piano, of
Rubinstein&rsquo;s Romance, of the ecstasy of his fantasia: the
glittering rainbows and the souls turning to angels. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To take leave?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>Jules nodded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Auntie, he is going away for ever so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could have shed tears himself and there were tears in his voice,
but he would not give way and his eyes merely grew moist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to ask you,&rdquo; he repeated, with
difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he can come and take leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Auntie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply, but lay staring before her. An emptiness began to
stretch before her, in endless vistas. It was a shadowy image of their
evening of rapture, but no light beamed out of the shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emptiness!&rdquo; she muttered through her closed lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Auntie?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229"
href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>She would have liked to ask Jules whether he was still, as formerly,
afraid of the emptiness within himself; but a gentleness of pity, a
soft feeling, a sweetening of the bitterness which filled her being,
stayed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To take leave?&rdquo; she repeated, with a smile of
melancholy; and the big tears fell heavily, drop by drop, upon her
fingers wrung together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Auntie&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could no longer restrain himself: a single sob convulsed his
throat, but he gave a cough to conceal it. Cecile threw her arm round
his neck:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very fond of &hellip; Taco, are you not?&rdquo; she
asked; and it struck her that this was the first time that she had
pronounced the name, for she had never called Quaerts by it: she had
never called him by any name. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>He did not answer at first, but nestled in her arm, in her embrace,
and began to cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can&rsquo;t tell you how fond I am of him,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said; and she thought of the rainbows and
the angels: he had played as out of her own soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May he come?&rdquo; asked Jules, loyally remembering his
instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asks if he might come this evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auntie, he is going away, because of &hellip; because of
&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of what, Jules?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of you: because you don&rsquo;t like him and will not
marry him! Mamma says so&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply; she lay sobbing, with her head against
Jules&rsquo; head. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231"
name="pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Auntie? No, it is not true, is
it?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised herself suddenly, conquering herself, and looked at him
fixedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going away because he must, Jules. I cannot tell you
why. But what he does is right. All that he does is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked at her, motionless, with large wet eyes, full of
astonishment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is right?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He is better than any one of us. If you go on loving
him, Jules, it will bring you happiness, even if &hellip; if you never
see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Does he bring
happiness? Even in that case?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even in that case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened to her own words as she <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>spoke: it was to her
as if another were speaking, another who consoled not only Jules but
herself as well and who would perhaps give her the strength to take
leave of Taco in the manner which would be best, without despair.

<p class="first">&ldquo;So you are going on a long journey?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>He sat facing her, motionless, with anguish on his face. Outwardly
she was very calm, only there was a sadness in her look and in her
voice. In her white dress, with the girdle falling before her feet, she
lay back among the three pillows of the <i>rose-moir&eacute;</i> sofa;
the tips of her little slippers were buried in the white sheepskin rug.
On the table before her lay a great bouquet of loose roses, pink, white
and yellow, bound together with a broad riband. He had brought them for
her and she had not yet placed them. There was a great calm about her;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>the exquisite atmosphere of the boudoir seemed
unchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, am I not paining you severely?&rdquo; he asked, with
the anguish in his eyes, the eyes which she now knew so well.</p>
<p>She smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will be honest with you. I have
suffered, but I suffer no longer. I have struggled with myself for the
second time and I have conquered myself. Will you believe
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew the remorse that I
feel&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose and went to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; she asked, in a clear voice. &ldquo;Because
you read me and gave me happiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I
thought&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href=
"#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I thought that you would &hellip; would
suffer so &hellip; and I &hellip; I cursed myself!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head gently, with smiling disapproval:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do not
blaspheme!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to forgive. Listen to me. Swear to me that you
believe me, that you believe that you have given me happiness and that
I am not suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &hellip; I swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust that you are not swearing this merely to satisfy my
wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been the highest thing in my life,&rdquo; he said,
gently.</p>
<p>A rapture shot through her soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me only&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me if you believe that I, I, <i>I</i> &hellip;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>shall always remain the highest thing in your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood before him, tall, in her clinging white. She seemed to
shed radiance; never had he seen her so beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certain of that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Certain, oh,
certain!&hellip; My God, how can I convey the certainty of it to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I believe you, I believe you!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>She laughed a laugh of rapture. In her soul a sun seemed to be
shooting forth rays on every side. She placed her arm tenderly about
his neck and kissed his forehead with a chaste caress.</p>
<p>For one moment he seemed to forget everything. He too rose, took her
in his arms, almost savagely, and clasped her suddenly to him, as if he
were about to crush her against his breast. She just caught sight of
his sad eyes; then she saw nothing more, blinded by the kisses of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>his mouth, which scorched her whole face as
though with sparks of fire. With the sun-rapture of her soul was
mingled a bliss of earth, a yielding to the violence of his embrace.
But the thought flashed across her of what she would lose if she
yielded. She released herself, put him away and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now &hellip; go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt stunned; he understood that he had no choice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I am going,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I may write to
you, may I not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded yes, with her smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write to me, I shall write to you too,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Let me always hear from you&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then these are not to be the last words between us? This
&hellip; this &hellip; is not the end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Good-bye, mevrouw, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>good-bye &hellip;
Cecile. Ah, if you knew what this moment costs me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be. It cannot be otherwise. Go, go. You must go. Do
go&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her hand again, for the last time. A moment later he
was gone.</p>

<p class="first">She looked about her strangely, with bewildered eyes,
with hands locked together:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; she repeated, like one
raving.</p>
<p>Then she noticed the roses. With something like a faint scream she
sank down before the little table and buried her face in his gift,
until the thorns wounded her face. The pain&mdash;two drops of blood
which fell from her forehead&mdash;brought her back to her senses.
Standing before the Venetian mirror hanging over her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>writing-table, she wiped away the red spots with
her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happiness!&rdquo; she stammered to herself. &ldquo;His
happiness! The highest thing in his life! So he knew happiness, though
short it was. But now &hellip; now he suffers, now he will suffer
again, as he did before. The remembrance of happiness cannot do
everything. Ah, if it could only do that, then everything would be
well, everything!&hellip; I wish for nothing more, I have had my life,
my own life, my own happiness; I now have my children; I now belong to
them. To him I must no longer be anything&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away from the mirror and sat down on the settee, as
though tired with a great space traversed, and she closed her eyes, as
though blinded with too great a light. She folded her hands together,
like one in prayer; her face <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>beamed in its fatigue, from smile
to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happiness!&rdquo; she repeated, faltering between her smiles.
&ldquo;The highest thing in his life! O my God, happiness! I thank
Thee, O God, I thank Thee!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
